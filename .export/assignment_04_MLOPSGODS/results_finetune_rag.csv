A reference letter is a crucial component of your application, providing additional evidence of your academic and personal achievements.  SUTD's admissions committee will consider your application without a reference letter, but the quality of your application will be significantly lower.  Therefore, it is highly recommended to provide a reference letter from a professor, mentor, or supervisor who can attest to your academic and professional capabilities.  This letter should be from the same academic institution or organization where you received your degree or training, and ideally, from someone who can speak to your character and leadership potential.  If you do not have a reference letter from a professor or mentor, you can provide a letter from a close friend or family member who can attest to your character and academic abilities.  However, the letter should be from someone who knows you well and can provide a detailed account of your achievements and strengths.  Ultimately, the absence of a reference letter does not automatically disqualify your application, but it significantly weakens your application and requires additional justification.  Therefore, it is crucial to provide a reference letter if possible.  If you are unable to secure a reference letter, you should still submit a detailed application, highlighting your achievements and strengths.  However, your application will be evaluated on its own merits and not penalized for lack of a reference letter.  In short, while SUTD does not explicitly require reference letters, their absence will significantly impact your application, so it is strongly recommended to provide a reference letter if possible.  If you are unable to secure one, you should still submit a detailed application, highlighting your achievements and strengths.  However, your application will be evaluated on its own merits and not penalized for lack of a reference letter.
