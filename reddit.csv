For hall activity/commitment, you would have to participate in atleast 1 hostel event every term (if I rmbr correctly).. but this is only if you want to apply for hostel after term 2.. if you don't want to, then you can just not go for the hostel events..

For me, I usually hear plane sounds at night (very subtle) when I switch off my fan.. it is not really that prominent.. However, I do have to have admit that those living near the toilet would have problems such as hearing the toilet door getting slammed :( but other than that, not really any other sound issues..

There are quiet hours (don't really rmbr exactly when), but there is absolutely no curfew.. it is all up to you when you want to go to hostel and when not to..

Study areas are vastly available during normal periods, but during exam periods you might have some difficulty finding areas to study.. you can only book certain areas to study.. 

Wifi coverage is pretty good, there are some rare instances when the wifi would be down, but other than that it is pretty good.

May have to pull the occasional late night, but that's expected at any uni.

1 and 2.   
A tip for you is to learn things smartly. Find a way to do things that you are good at. For example, I usually attend class not doing pre-reading, as I feel I use my time in the most impactful way to accelerate my learning. People scold, but you know yourself the best.  


I also like to organize my thoughts when I listen to lectures, write down what I don't know, and ask my prof after class. A good trait I learned to having a good relationship with my prof, being attentive and asking critical, sometimes stupid, questions, and showing that you are interested in the class (usually I would describe my thought process and how I derive so-and-so conclusion), such that he/she entertains you, know where you are at and you get what you want.  


4.   
Soft skills/non-academics are also essential when working. Having academics will bring you through the interviews and perhaps, a few years down the road.

It also depends on what your arrangement is here.

k8ridys,"whether SUTD has ""better mental health"" is hugely dependent on the individual - how well you do working in group projects, coping with crammed courses and heavy 5th row involvement.

For groupwork, we do 4-6 group projects every term and all the deadlines are crammed into the same 2-3 weeks. For the courses, we typically cram a lot of content into the 14 weeks because we dont have as much specialisation as NUS and NTU to afford spreading it into 2 separate modules. School is smaller so it gets harder to get committed people in your CCAs (or 5th rows as we call them).

Also its a lot easier to get into SUTD and once you get in, you are guaranteed to get whichever pillar you pick. so its easy to get into CS compared to NUS/NTU. SUTD will consider your CCA and leadership skills, and your portfolio of projects. if you're interested in CS, i suggest making some projects, putting it on github and deploying it.

CSD used to be called ISTD and was only recently renamed in 2022 and I am not sure if there is any changes in course contents to reflect this name change. But essentially the professors teaching CSD will also teach some modules in DAI. The key difference is the Design portion where the professors in Architecture will be the key people teaching. 

Teaching wise, all educators are supposedly trained to conduct lessons where there is alot of hands-on, active learning. So many modules especially the freshies they will be held in a class of not more than 50 students instead of lecture style. in the classroom, there are multiple whiteboards and projectors and whenever possible, the class will breakout into small groups to solve problems or questions. 

Not sure if you know about the big 'D' but it is supposed to integrate design projects in 4 dimensions into the curriculum. So 1D is design projects within modules, 2D is design projects across the same cohort, 3D is across different cohorts, etc. So no matter which degree programme, you will expect a lot of project work.

The key challenge for DAI is that the industry may not fully understand what the course teaches and how it is relevant to the employers and how it compares with traditional Computer Science graduates. Those that do appreciates the DAI graduates, will likely be your only choices for employment - this means you will likely be working with your classmates.

Only in the last 2 years (3~ terms) do they get to choose mods that they want to focus on based on their specialization. For CS it could be AI or cybersecurity, mechanical or electrical for engineering etc. If you're just looking at specific specializations then yes the graduates would be closer to the range you have in mind.",2023-08-24 02:39:37,NEU

jxi38l0,"Historically each batch has been about 400+ students, give or take. This year will see a significantly larger intake of 600-ish students. Bear in mind that we have a common first year for all students so the 400-600 will be spread across the 5 pillars ( equivalent to faculties in other unis), meaning the CS course will see 100-200++ students (other courses like archi have historically low numbers, 60-80 but might change due to the new higher intake)



SUTD keeps its intake low because of their emphasis on the low student to faculty ratio, last advertised as 11:1, in order to keep learning effective for students.. On top of the small campus, limited housing options and availability of food on-campus, it doesn't make a lot of sense to just suddenly take in 2000+ students like they do in other unis faculties.",2023-08-24 02:23:07,NEU

1 I mostly buy out but there are people who precook whole weeks meal(meal prep) if your group of friend cooks then you can have meals quite offen

2 Hostel toilets are mostly clean from my experiance dont understand what ""  specific place to like change? "" means. Crowded is based on who stays there if for example most people have morning classes at 8:30 at 8 the toilet will be ""crowed"" (the 4 sinks to brush teeth is occupied) 

3 Laptop offers never heard of this thing before if you have any info I would love to know more. CSD for best bang for buck use the money on a lap top to get a desk PC then screen share it to your old laptop the prossesing power of your PC whould do you great. But I dont know about laptop.

4 fifth rows you need to ask about what cluster are you attending but generaly it is all at night 6-10 can have thing normaly it is like 2 hours? Take more in the 1 sem as it is pass fail unless you have special scheams like me which then 1 sem is not pass fail.

General rule is that 1 sem people get 3-5 fifth rows then cut the commitment to 1 or 2. Balancing see you school stuff is honestly quite managable if you can plan well and not over commit/procrasinate. (you can be more spercific on the fifth rows you want to attend?)

Also you may rage as some things like connecting USB device may be dumb at first as you don't know VM but later it is very simple.

Yes. Mostly freshmore. Based on what I have seen, usually they usually do not have the right study ethics/discipline. For example, there is a distinct difference between ""Oh can I copy your homework?"" Rather than "" oh can I compare your homework?"" And then ask questions to clarify. 

Of course, there are other ways to learn. But uh... Help is available. Professors got help sessions and there are TAs also. You just need to put in effort.

And uh.. you will be surprised on who are people dropping out. They are some from hwa Chong/vjc. So for my freshie class, 3/40. University makes you to be more independent... Much lesser spoon feeding cus diff environment.

There is also another dimension in dropping out. Just don't be a playboy/bastard to everyone. One of the drop outs is being hated by everyone cus of the nasty things he did intentionally and repeatedly despite repeated feedbacks back to him. Hence, no one likes him. That environment hence become bad for him, hence drop out.

Financial help is okay.... If your goal is to be a high flyer but lack the financial capabilities... There are mid term and full scholarship available. I have earned my mid term scholarship by working hard and retaining... So it is sustainable. If you didn't manage to hit it, getting a decent-ish gpa and doing part time is also sustainable. Just really need to manage yourself.

But I must say don't worry so much. If the shit falls on you, take one at a time and slowly. There are shit that seem urgent but they are not really. 

And also, there are different ways of becoming successful. For example, school can be a platform for startup launchpad. School can also be a platform to hone your soft skills, like managing an event, where you can afford to make mistakes. Not getting a good GPA is okay.

jpbtgr0,"HAHA I'm glad you asked! I myself got in through early admission! 

I'm not sure if they've changed anything but here's the process that took place for me.

I got a message from my JC to apply for early admission. I'm not sure about applying on your own, that's just how it happened for me c':

They took a look at my prelim results and then invited me to a workshop to attend. During this workshop they introduced the SUTD curriculum and the SUTD way and culture. It's basically a design thinking workshop that introduces you to important concepts you will learn throughout your SUTD years.

After the workshop, we were grouped up and then went to attend a group interview. My interview was with one interviewer and 3 interviewees. They asked me the usual questions, like where do I see myself in X years. They did also ask about SUTD specific things like whether I like making things and how I tackle a problem I don't have the answer to or have no experience doing.

I've had friends tell me they've had physics and math questions in their interview but I didn't face that so I'm not sure.

After the interview they eventually emailed me saying they wanted to see my A-level results before informing me of my admission results. I did have a U in my prelims so that might have been the reason for that but I can't be too sure.

Just be yourself! The skills and people they're tryna look for are people who are willing to learn and better themselves. People who aren't afraid to fail so that they can learn! For example, I mentioned having no computing education or experience but mentioned I liked watching videos on youtube to learn and have been watching CS50 lectures as well. An appreciation for a holistic education is a plus too. 

All the best and hope to see you in SUTD!",2023-06-24 08:41:36,POS

jpbhocg,"Current SUTD student here!

I'm happy to help answer your questions about SUTD if you have any but here's my advice for you based on what you're asking.

As some have already mentioned, you don't need to ""qualify"" for CSD, you just need to be accepted into SUTD then you're free to choose whatever course you want during your third term of study.

The important thing to note here is that you're only choosing your course in your third term!! What this means is that courses in terms 1, 2 and 3 (sort of for term 3) are gonna be common for all SUTD students. This includes two compulsory physics mods. I don't mean to scare you but speaking as someone who did take H2 Physics, it's hard af. This is a sentiment shared by many in my cohort. On the bright side, you will be able to take these mods as S/U, or pass fail. This means that these mods won't affect your GPA so long as you pass the mods. That takes away a lot of the pressure of doing well.

I do have friends with no physics background who survived the first two terms then proceeded to do CSD, or any of the other courses where physics isn't a big part. So don't be afraid to give it a go.

What I would like to add on, as an extra piece of advice is, if you're sure you wanna do CS, SUTD is an option but it might not be the best option. SUTD is a place to explore more before truly deciding on what you wanna do. Don't come in with CS tunnel vision! You'll find your first two or three terms a lot less enjoyable that way. Be open to learning about other things and who knows! You might end up choosing Architecture HAHA",2023-06-24 06:02:40,POS
jp845m7,Also only took O-level physics but I did the free a level physics courses on brilliant.org for a few weeks before matriculation to catch up. (List of topics should be on the page for SS ILP). Anyway I think they‚Äôre mostly relevant for the first term only.,2023-06-23 14:14:19,POS
jp837ug,"You do not need grades to get into CSD. Everyone is guaranteed their choice of pillar. What you'll need to worry about is getting into SUTD in the first place. 



Afaik RP ranges are low 70s to perfect 90 for people who were admitted historically. There may be students with sub-70 RP but I don't know any. 



Physics is not needed for CSD but it is very math heavy, especially very popular mods like machine learning. Physics is needed for your freshmore terms (i.e. term 1 and 2) that everyone will have to take regardless of which pillar you intend to go to.",2023-06-23 14:07:33,NEU

They invited me over for my research proposal today. I was given only 2.5 days to prepare for it, but I only started working on it on the second day as I was ill with diarrhea.

Preparing a detailed research proposal and summarizing my previous research experiences at the last minute was incredibly challenging. I had to sift through scientific papers and literature to find a suitable research topic worthy of investigation as well as summarize my previous research work. However, I understand that as a PhD student, we need to work around short deadlines.

The proposal was conducted in the presence of the professor as well as 4 other faculty members.  I am not by any means an exceptional student, lacking extensive research experience and knowledge beyond my previous field of study in biomedical science. In fact, I was surprised they even asked me to present my research proposal (but I believe it was because my Statement Objectives were incredibly well written for the application).
Consequently, it was difficult to address their inquiries and concerns regarding my proposed research and the gaps in my knowledge. Overall, I believe I did not perform particularly well.

While the outcome of the application isn't out yet, I am not quite positive I will get in. Nonetheless, I will provide an update on this thread regarding the final outcome.

Please prepare a draft/idea of your research proposal when you're applying for a PhD program, as it would be best to spend as least 2 days reading up on current literature as well as brainstorm on ideas before drafting research proposal.

jmxax5f,"Uhh... It is the same. - TA-ed systems and control. I was not even paid, cus there is demand for being TA. In fact, most aren't paid.

The forty dollar kind is like holiday SEM which sutd dont have.

Personally, getting a ta job is more or less first come first serve. As long as the prof feels that you are a fit and fit the min. Requirement, which is usually at least a B, you can become TA

(P.s. why I took is cus I feel that I should give to the school :) )",2023-06-04 23:38:17,NEU
jmvy7ch,Yeah heard of those part time job but $10/h is quite low these days. Not sure how much a TA pays in SUTD but hearing from friends in NUS they got paid $40/h.

jkzbawc,"1) A GPA of 3.5 should be quite manageable as long as you're consistent and you play your cards right. There are JC kids who struggle and poly kids who excel, and the reverse is also true. It depends on the person and how they manage their time. Note that GPA is not end all be all, though you did mention you'd be under scholarship so the minimum to maintain it is 3.5. Count yourself lucky as some scholarships require a minimum of 4.2 or up to 4.4. 




2) I didn't get a chance to apply for overseas programmes in EPD due to COVID, but based on experiences from seniors they do recommend going for it. Application can be competitive due to limited slots, especially for more popular destinations like the US and Europe, so you'll need be more outstanding in your portfolio/interview or play it safe(r) and apply to less popular destinations. You'll need to spend some time with an academic mentor (prof) to map your modules before going over but once all that is done, you should be able to enjoy yourself. Your GPA is frozen while you're on exchange and the mods are pass/fail (you must pass though), so you have quite a good opportunity to enjoy yourself and maybe travel a bit 




3) It depends. The things they take into consideration are distance from school, any prior offences and if you participate actively in hostel events, where attendance is taken. If you live close by (i.e. east side), was issued letter of warning from housing office, or didn't have stellar attendance for hostel events then your chances of getting a slot diminishes significantly, but not impossible to get. 




4) Unique depends on what you're interested in. You can try ballroom dancing if you want to try a unique performing arts fifth row.

jkyx7xj,"Hello,

Generally not. For Physical World, for which I can speak,
most of the questions have symbols representing the quantities (r for radius for example, rather than 2cm‚Ä¶) hence the calculator would be useless. 
In homework questions though, there are questions that at times require the use of a scientific calculator. 
If you already own a graphic calculator, all the better. If your calculator is only scientific, it is perfectly fine. There is no need to buy anything expensive. A $20 calculator will do.

Don‚Äôt be shy to ask for assistance if you need it. You are seen as an actively participating student who will surely score well in participation marks, and you will contribute to better quality teaching, for the benefit of everyone, including the instructors.",2023-05-21 00:27:10,NEU

Courses for term 1 and 2 are fixed for the freshmore curriculum. You should be able to find all of these on the school website. Term 3 is when you first get to choose which electives you want to take, but these are not specific to pillars yet. 



Term 4 onwards is when you start to delve into pillar-specific mods. Afaik term 4 mods are the same for everyone in the pillar. For EPD at the very least, term 5 is where you start to get to choose your electives, though there is only 1 slot to choose and it's just between 2 mods. Term 6 onwards is when you actually get the freedom to choose whichever mods you want to pick up, as long as it fulfills your specialisation track requirements. All pillar specific mods can be found in their respective websites. 



You may be thinking of unrestricted electives. This is where you can take cross-pillar mods. There isn't a list of mods that you can easily reference.

There are mods that are very practical and logical, some are more historical and analyses, some are philosophical and abstract. This is why its important to talk to seniors to understand what is taught in different mods, what's the workload like, what expectations do the profs have, what assignments/finals are graded. Some mods have a final essay, some are a final project. 



Don't worry too much about the mods. They are fun for the most part if you choose carefully, and its also important to go into a mod with friends so that you can help each other out in class.

jioap0z,"About student life, while I would personally think that SUTD has enough of it, it definitely cannot compare to NUS (where some halls are basically famous for their culture at this point).

You don‚Äôt have to apply for hostel every semester. Depending on how you time it, you mostly end up applying once every year.

Tech entrepreneurship definitely isn‚Äôt for everyone. There are people inside STEP right now who probably knew nothing about tech entrepreneurship. Until we finished some of our workshops and modules, I‚Äôd even say that most had a gross misunderstanding of what tech entrepreneurship was (including myself).

One of our guests from a Fireside Chat a while back said something that I think you‚Äôll appreciate: ‚ÄúNot everyone should be an entrepreneur, but everyone should be entrepreneurial‚Äù.

You don‚Äôt need such a gung-ho attitude to make use of opportunities in STEP (though we would certainly appreciate more fellas who do)! So long as you have an interest in going beyond your boundaries, I think there should be opportunities for you. If you want overseas opportunities, NUS has NOC that you can apply for while SUTD STEP has a guaranteed year. If you want opportunities to start something of your own, SUTD is increasing support year by year while NUS already has an established foundation you can start from.

I think your mindset is there whether you go to NUS or SUTD. I think you‚Äôre asking questions that I should have asked before I came into STEP myself. Just keep in mind that it‚Äôs going to be molded by where you go. SUTD is just saturated by the ‚Äútry and find out‚Äù project mindset while NUS is more structured. I‚Äôd mostly say it‚Äôs up to you which one you‚Äôd like more.

Feel free to ask more questions (via DM if you want to). A lot of things I‚Äôve said here are quite general and going into specifics will need more than your standard GP essay to get it all out, but I will answer any questions as best I can.",2023-05-03 08:50:48,NEU

also i‚Äôd like to know from your perspective, to me tech entrepreneurship isn‚Äôt so much something i can see myself doing rn like it‚Äôs definitely an interest but im not sure how much of that interest i can make use of to change it into a pursuit or passion? like no matter which uni i go to, i would love to try things related to start ups and proj and i love that sutd has that env but im not 100% sure how onz i will be abt that in the future‚Ä¶ rn im thinking more abt tech/engineering & business (which could potentially become entrepreneurship) but do you think this is the right mindset/goals to have if i were to enter step? i‚Äôm sure i could adapt to step as in im always open to learn but would that be like not making use the opportunities v well in step‚Ä¶",2023-05-03 04:05:25,POS
jinimip,"Hello! Before I go into answering your questions specifically, maybe this would give you some insight first: https://reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/12e7slb/_/jfewe0z/?context=1  

You might want to look at the whole thread, though I think you have a good understanding of STEP as a programme from your post.

About student life in SUTD specifically, I would like to be very honest here. If you‚Äôre not looking for projects to do (personal ones or otherwise), there won‚Äôt be much in terms of that. This however comes from a person who spent most of my time in Maker Clubs (except Drama, which is in a whole different universe) so take this with a major grain of salt. We do have clubs for Sports, Arts and Community, but they‚Äôre mostly casual with a few exceptions.

SUTD is a place where you can throw a stone and hit somebody who‚Äôs working on their own 3D printer, a startup, or some other endeavor. That‚Äôs not to say that we don‚Äôt have a life outside of engineering; there are plenty of people interested in normal things and hobbies or go out for nights at Changi Village or Tampines East (though some months of the year are too busy to do so).

STEP itself is a programme that‚Äôs evolving alongside its community. The seniors in California are having a good time right now, and are setting the foundation for future batches to go. As for its community (and we‚Äôre opening up to the whole school more recently), we do have a growing community that engages in events and workshops, but I don‚Äôt believe that is the student life you‚Äôre looking for either.

That said, I don‚Äôt really know what you‚Äôre looking for in terms of student life; are you asking about general welfare by the school, or about the work-life ethic? SUTD is a pretty hardcore school if you choose to go deep into your focus, but you‚Äôre not forced to do so, and some might even find it conducive. Perhaps it might be better for you to clarify a bit further.

Edit: I‚Äôm a current Term 4 student of STEP, so feel free to ask me specific questions about the programme, even technical ones if you need to!",2023-05-03 03:20:39,NEU

jge372d,"Like what hypothesistesting said, usually talking is the way out. I would prob hope to request them to do min. work required/min. expectation that you can compromise with in terms of work ethics.

I think it is also pre-emptive to rally people before taking drastic action. Align your opinions first cus sometime maybe it is just your perspective, others might feel different

If that guy refuses to talk/ trying to taiji your questions, what I would do is to align with everyone else and to be fair with everyone and do whatever is necessary like peer review and reports, since I have done my due diligence. (Usually people who really care will look up to peer reviews and if there is overwhelming response, he/she will take necessary action. If his/her grades would be q bad).

Ofc, comes with the cost of sacrificing your should-have-been-free time. Just like other comments, I think it is a good lesson learnt before going to the workplace.

But also .. must think on hindsight, if like the GPA is pretty much stable (like towards the final year), I think that is where you can focus on learning, rather than chasing GPA too.( Or probably chase other goals rather than academics)

And...fyi.... I told deadweights are still okay... Say just like 1 or 2 in a group out of like 6? 4 good persons still can tank the weight.

But uh...if it is an overwhelming majority, well I guess it sucks... As much as I want to think of a good solution, I can't.

What I scared the most is terrorists. Meaning they mess up the good work that you have done for how many days/weeks. Why? Reasons can really vary.

jgdo0eq,"I feel like the ~model answer~ is to talk to them (kindly) and find out what‚Äôs happening, perhaps if they have any issues preventing them from doing their part. They could be going through a really rough patch, for example.

But sometimes, that might not help. Some people are just‚Ä¶not team players. They simply don‚Äôt care and/or can‚Äôt be bothered. It sucks but you (and the rest of your team) gotta find a way around it, and perhaps use peer review to indicate that the so-called teammate didn‚Äôt do anything for the project. Bringing it up to the prof may help, but in this instance there might not be much the prof can do this late into the project/term.

You can also send an email or chat with your assigned academic mentor (or another prof you‚Äôre on good terms with) to get some advice on how to deal with these issues (and other topics in general, seriously my academic mentor was A++).",2023-04-15 17:17:00,NEG

Generally they ask questions like 
1. Tell me about yourself
2. What did you choose sutd over other Uni 
3. What inspired u to choose that course 
4. I personally got 2 mcq math qns (it‚Äôs easy if u rmb the basics like algebra and graph)
5. I didnt get this qn but my friend got an estimation qn 

also don‚Äôt worry too much because the interview is more like a student teacher conversation they are usually very friendly. A tip for u is interviewers usually like to test u if you‚Äôre really keen in the course by discouraging u and telling u reasons why u shouldn‚Äôt join.

j9pjlo1,"The different scholarships will likely only affect your chances of going on an overseas trip under the school if the scholarship already comes with the opportunity to travel. The school wants to be fair to all students and allow each student the opportunity to travel at least once, so if you are already guaranteed a trip/have travelled before, chances are the likelihood of your application being accepted will be lower, but not impossible. You will likely still attend the interview and undergo the review process (i.e. grade requirements)



Internships are different as this is up to the companies entirely - the school merely acts as the intermediary to put up the positions that are available. Alternatively, you can always self-source an internship company yourself, but will be subject to review as the company will need to layout a workplan for your 16 weeks with them (they want to avoid companies using you for menial labour like coffee runs or photocopying work). Overseas opportunities with internship companies are rare but not unheard of. Some places I know of are Cambodia/Laos for de-mining projects from the war, or Japan for architectural internships. 


I'm not sure about many people continuing to work for their internship company after completing the 16 weeks but I do know many people who continued to do so in their own capacity (i.e. part time work). The work is usually limited in scope as students need to juggle academics and work, but I do know several people who have extended their internships or continued to work part time beyond their original contract. 


Job offers after internship are not super common, but it is not unusual for students to reach out to their old intern companies through their supervisors to check for available positions as they approach graduation in preparation to find a job, and I find that most people are quite successful. There are also instances that supervisors reach out with job offers instead. 


There's various types of scenarios that I have witnessed. Some people continue working part time after internship and transition to a full time position upon graduation (dnata, Carousell, Indeed), some return to their old intern company upon graduation (DSO), and many find new jobs or get referred in various industries (Cognizant, ST Engineering). It is also not uncommon for people to switch industries after graduation.

j9nfirn,"Again, it really depends on the situation. Majority of research that undergraduates will get a chance to try out is in the form of collaborations or through the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programme (UROP).

&#x200B;

Collaborations can come in many forms. An example would be between professors/research groups and Fifth Rows (CCAs). The EV club in school recently culminated an almost 2-year long project with one of the school's labs to produce an electric vehicle with metal 3D printed components. The robotics club-equivalent also regularly collaborates with the UROP office or other professors to work on various types of robots, such as underwater drones.

&#x200B;

Students also get a chance to join professors who put up UROP projects that are looking for student volunteers. Duties can range from data processing, field testing or prototyping. Students can also submit a request to initiate a UROP project by themselves, as long as they get the backing of a professor. All projects get funding from the school (with a cap) and any IP will belong to the school (as usual)

&#x200B;

Again, research opportunities are always there, just that they may not suit everyone's tastes, or some people don't even bother trying to look them up. Some programmes are more popular than others, especially projects through Fifth Rows, with some being exclusively through the Fifth Row. Depending on where you go, there will be some doors that close for you but there will always be others who stay open.

j9kb3y8,"I'd add to the overseas opportunities that it really depends on the situation. There are really A LOT of overseas opportunities that the school offers, be it internship, exchange, competition or visits. Most of the time, it is the students who are being selective with what they want (i.e. want to go Berlin for HASS mods, Taiwan for EPD mods).


Would you go overseas exchange but not be able to map any mods? Most would say why bother, its a waste of time, but I do have friends who have gone to Berkeley on exchange and took all mods that couldn't be mapped, purely out of interest, and I'd say few people would take up that opportunity. Majority of people who end up not going overseas didn't bother applying in the first place because they didn't see something they liked (at least speaking to my batchmates, immediate juniors and seniors)


Limited slots are a given, as is being accepted into any university course, so things will definitely be competitive. The opportunities are always there, and you lose nothing by applying. Last I heard, they added a lot more universities to the exchange list so the opportunities are still growing",2023-02-22 16:41:07,NEU
j9jzstd,">Highest starting salary

Not sure where they get their values from tbh. As a matter of fact they only give 1 value for their graduate earning salary. To do a proper comparison it's obviously best to look at 2 grads with a similar enough role. E g. Does an ASD graduate earn more than an Architecture graduate from NUS? Or an EPD graduate and an engineering NUS graduate who are both roboticists?

>100% overseas opportunities

Depends on what you mean by that. If you mean you can go overseas without going through much selection process, I'll say the opportunities are mainly from GLP (summer programs) and FACT (1 week trip to another asian university, linked to one of the freshmore subjects). GEXP (exchange program) on the other hand has limited slots, and can be quite competitive.

j58yzqf,"Hmm as an EPD grad ( but my track is mechE), sutd is more interdisciplinary. As a design engineer now, I would need skills that are quite interdisciplinary too. It is also essential to know what other people are doing so that you won't get lost in meetings. For example, me understanding the limits of what an EE or com scientist can and cannot do, and also contribute well into the meeting. Sometimes, you probably need to apply skills you are not specialized in. At times, I have to code Arduino/python to make a machine to test my mechanical system or tap power from an establish prototype (Why? cus I don't have lead time) The rationale here is to be adaptive and flexible to fast track the things you would learn out there in the workforce, while university provides the basic foundation you need so that you won't be stranded in nowhere land. Bear in mind universities will have significantly less spoonfeeding.

And like what typical sutd marketing would say, sutd provide a chance to switch your major (i.e. try for a year then you choose what you want to do) which quite a substantial people I know act switch.

And uh... Design here in sutd is not everything artsy stuff.  Our concept of design is more of solving problems, more of engineering problem. It is also another scope of looking at things, such as the old ""here is the problem, hence solve it"", but rather ""here is a problem, but actually is it a problem?"" And ofc, sutd does teach the technical engineering skills to solving it, but not as deep as NTU/nus, but we are broader in terms of interdisciplinarity. And uh... There are more aspects of design rather than just this... Which sutd in turn forces students to take humanities classes almost every term (around 1/4 of your curriculum would be humanities)

About whether you can get a job... I think it is very possible to get one, esp if you put in the effort. The fabrication lab is readily available to use or urop for you to do. If you wanna beef up your resume and do more project, I think sutd have the resource to do so...( Maybe go linkedin and bomb a random EE grad to ask, hence a piece of better advice and also bear in mind doing a project is only feasible if you have spare time after your studies and what not). If you want to find where sutd grad goes, linkedin can be a way to track them ;)

Generally, workload in sutd is sometimes unpredictable... Like due to bad teammates or project politics. But I personally think that it is a learning experience that everyone should experience before going to the workforce.

But uhh... As a grad after experiencing sutd, not everything is just work work, get a good GPA, and then get a job. Also, you prob need to decide what kind of experience really make you a better version of yourself after 4 years of study.",2023-01-21 06:20:03,NEU

There are official ways you can get into a urop(at the end of every term) but most likely you will miss it you can check the schedule at SUTD website.

If you missed it just check out the faculty research interests and when you find something you like just email them and explain what you want to do.

Most urops are rather chill what you get from it is if you put in the effort. But it is a case-by-case basis I heard some professors are really bad. So if you have an area in mind find a professor in that area and email them what project they have. Then figure out if they have the project you want and are the right professor for you.

You can ask around if the professor is any good. They should accept you even if you don't have any experience. SUTD is so small that when you find your interest you keep on seeing the same people where ever you go. (they don't mind grooming you if you have the interest)

But don't just suddenly ghost them because urops have little backlash when you leave. They have deadlines to meet doing that is irresponsible.

ip6jh44,"Hi, I just graduated, Class of 2022, am 25. Was a poly engineering grad when I matriculated into SUTD.

Following SUTD admission criteria, specifically minimum qualifications, you will likely have to apply with your Local Poly Diploma (https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Application/Admission-Requirements/Local-Polytechnic-Diploma) despite your prior work experience. However, I don't think it's a hard sell to say both your qualifications and work experiences are highly relevant to what SUTD is looking for. Depends how you word it in your enrolment submission. I'll say just give it a shot.

What I'm more concerned about is you having to adapt to the study environment after having been out of touch for so long. For the first year common courses mentioned, there is a strong emphasis on Maths and Science concepts with some programming and design course sprinkled in. It's more akin to JC studies with a healthy dose of projects on top. While I have no doubt that your work experience can help in your time management when juggling the courses, just be prepared to seek help from the fresh JC and Poly grads that are much younger for both projects and theory. SUTD is not a uni you can get a bachelors from with sheer willpower working alone. Other than that, best of luck. Wish you the best if you decide to submit an application.",2022-09-20 11:33:26,NEU
ip66p0i,"First of all, thank you so much for responding! 

Secondly, Yes you are right. I am applying to the undergraduate programme. My biggest worry is that I will not be able to get accepted by the school (and I understand that nobody is able to give me a definite answer for this, all I can do is send in my application and hope for the best), because I dont have an outstanding portfolio, and also not coming from an engineering/science background.

I am aware that having a background in engineering/science is more relavant to SUTD's courses, or at least I need to be good in mathematics and physics.

ip64omt,"Help us understand your situation - are you applying to SUTD's undergraduate programme or post-graduate programme?

&#x200B;

Based on what you have indicated, you are a diploma holder, meaning you will likely be applying to the undergraduate programme. For undergraduates, your first 2/3 trimesters are foundation terms. Most undergraduates are fresh out of poly/JC/NS, and while age gap may be a concern for you, fret not as regardless of which pillar you intend to choose (ASD/CSD/EPD/ESD/DAI), everyone is required to go through the same foundation. Only after your first 3 terms do you go into your selected pillar (in your case, ASD)

&#x200B;

For post-graduate programmes (i.e Masters or PhD), this is where most people apply after working (and graduating with a bachelors). People have varied working experiences, from 0 (i.e. continue studying immediately after finishing bachelors) to several years in the industry. Generally they feel a bit out of place as it takes some getting used to the rigour of academia again, but they let their working experience guide them in their studies, such as professional work ethic, connections to suppliers/vendors, team/project management etc.

&#x200B;

For undergraduates, you will have to work in teams with fellow students for projects, so contributing your experience will definitely be appreciated. For post-graduate studies, you will likely be working solo for your thesis/research, but knowing how to manage your time goes a long way. Regardless of which route you are in, don't feel pressured to already know what to do, and don't be afraid to ask questions.",2022-09-20 08:15:11,NEU

We do have procedures to follow when there is any emergency situation and often we do need to get certain information from the pilots. However that particular incident was a big learning lesson for me and my colleagues as it brought in the concept of [ASIST](https://skybrary.aero/articles/guidelines-dealing-unusualemergency-situations-atc). Instead of rushing to resolve emergency situations, being calm and compose is the better approach. 

In addition, as many ATCs do not have Aviation background, there aren‚Äôt many who knows much in the operations of Flying an aircraft.

With regards to Airspace Classifications, yes Singapore also follows the ICAO classifications from A to G.

Take driving as an example. Change of lanes involve the following steps; 1) Look ahead for sufficient space. 2) Signal Blinker 3) Check rearview mirror 4) Check sideview mirror 5) Check blindspot 6) Execute lane change with a small amount of acceleration. Between each steps are small decision making of whether to proceed with the land change or reassess the situation. 

How many drivers at the learning stage do these checks diligently? After just passing and having the license for a year? How about after 3 years? 

Having a good consistent habit of systematically checking regardless of how light or heavy of aircraft traffic is in my opinion the most important skillset of a controller. It‚Äôs very easy to be tempted to skip a step occasionally thinking that have a complete mental picture when in fact there could be blind spots. By being consistent and knowing that you‚Äôre consistent will help in giving the confidence that you did your checks and you can execute instructions knowing that it‚Äôs safe.

HF is super noisy compared to VHF and UHF so it‚Äôs additionally straining on the ears to keep a listening watch. 

At night due to the lack of the  sun, HF frequencies are even less energised and very often we do not received position reports directly from pilots. This results to us trying to relay through other means in order to continue providing ATC services. 

ACARS on the other hand is a direct Pilot to Controller communications, with milliseconds of delay, templates formats of text messages that reduces ambiguity, and it also works along ADS-C which will also give us an exact coordinate position of the aircraft.",2022-08-23 00:46:03,NEU

So usually when there is a weather cell along a flight path, pilots will request for some slight deviation away from the path to avoid the weather.

I had to confirm with the pilot. ‚ÄúConfirm One Zero Zero Miles?‚Äù The pilot said yes. 

Other annoying ones will include telling a pilot on descent to maintain a particular level due to a conflicting traffic that is 1,000 feet below them.

With regards to social life, i do feel that it‚Äôs a lot more difficult for me to schedule meetups with friends who are not ATC. But i do consider many ATCs as friends and we do hang out often on our day offs. 

It becomes routine after awhile. So I won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs difficult or easy. Could be different from person to person.",2022-08-22 17:52:48,POS

Looking at the shift pattern, meaning you guys don't get consecutive 2 days off? How does it affect your social life and family commitment?

How tough is it having to start/end work at different time of the day?",2022-08-22 16:30:31,POS
ilc5x16,"Three shifts. AM is from 8.30 to 5pm. PM shift is from 3pm to 11.30pm. Night shift is from 11pm to 9am. 

I work a 5 days shift cycle in the following sequence; PM PM, Off, AM AM, Off, Night, Rest. 

I like your question about weather deviation in HF. It‚Äôs so specific. Are you a pilot?

So in HF environment it‚Äôs usually outside of Radar coverage. This means that we use Procedural control and separation. 

The safety bubble for procedural separation is a lot bigger than surveillance. Surveillance usually requires 5-7nm of Lateral Separation. Procedural can require from 30-100nm Lateral Separation depending on aircrafts‚Äôs on board avionics and air routes. So checking of traffic to give deviation clearances is more challenging for procedural than surveillance. On top of that, we have to coordinate with either other sectors, or adjacent ATS units to make sure that our deviation in Procedural airspace does not conflict with theirs. 

To give an example, the common air route from Changi to Tokyo, would fly a particular route that is in Procedural control. If the pilot requests for extensive deviation, we may need to confirm with Ho Chin Minh (who is just north of this air route) whether they have any traffic on their side who could be a potential conflict with the current pilot‚Äôs request. If there is any conflict then I‚Äôll negotiate for either a maximum extend of deviation that both pilot and Ho Chi Minh can accept. Meanwhile as a backup plan, i will also start to check my traffic for an alternate cruising level, that is free from any conflict to facilitate to the pilot‚Äôs deviation request if the previous solution is not favourable to the pilot. 

In short, the reason for the delay is mainly due to the extra steps in applying Procedural separation as well as any coordination required to facilitate in the Pilot‚Äôs request.",2022-08-22 16:13:21,NEU

ilbvyy8,"I believe that ATC positions globally are mostly either public or civil service positions. So different countries pay their ATC at different salary. 

I cannot say for other countries as every single country have very different circumstances, regulations, and procedures on top of those that are standardised by ICAO. 

With regards to air safety, i believe that paying good dollar for the best people with the best tools and training is a fundamental need to ensure safety between vessels in the air and on the ground, especially when you‚Äôre talking about hundreds of traffic movement per day between aircrafts holding hundreds of lives. 

A pilots duty is to ensure the safe transportation of people from point A to B, from take off to landing, and making the difficult decisions when  shit hits the fan. ATC‚Äôs role is to ensure safety by making sure no aircrafts are in close proximity from each other and aiding in Pilots to land safely. I believe that ATC‚Äôs contribution to society does deserve top dollar. 

As for Automation, i do look up research on AI/ML on how we can possibly work towards full automation. But there are complex political issues across different Air Traffic Services in the world that it‚Äôs not a foreseeable future at this time. Furthermore, as ATC is a global operation, we cannot have just one country in full automation and leaving the rest behind. From developed to developing countries, any ATC function or services have to be collaborative in order for traffic to move smoothly. If automation does occur in ATC, i would say maybe the bigger countries with larger FIRs like China, US or Australia can fully automate their Domestic flights. But even then i still many problems that are yet to be solved.",2022-08-22 15:08:31,NEU
ilbu4fn,"1) They have changed certain details of the interview process but i can tell you about my experience. 

There was a 2 hour aptitude test that will test some basic arithmetic, logic, reaction, memory and some beginner ATC related questions. No background knowledge is required. 

There will also be two rounds of interviews where they will ask you why you want to be ATC, whether are you comfortable with shift work. They will also make you read a simple ATC spiel to see how well you enunciate words and your rate of speech. Plus a requirement to introduce yourself to your potential new bosses. 
 
2) For my first rating, it took a whole year. 

There is a 4 months Primary ATC course where they will cover fundamental topics. These include Aerodynamics, Air Navigation, Meteorology, ICAO Chapters, Rules of the Air, General ATC Procedures, and more which i cannot remember off hand. 

Next there is a small attachment of about a week where they‚Äôll bring you to each of the different facilities to see how different streams of ATC operate at their respective locations. Specifically, Changi Tower to see how Aerodrome Controllers work, and Singapore Air Traffic Control Centre to see how Approach and Enroute controllers work. There could be a chance to visit Seletar Tower as well. 

Next will be the streaming process where you‚Äôll learn and trainers will evaluate you on simple procedures for each of the three branches (Aerodrome, Approach, and Enroute). You‚Äôll have a say in your preference on which ‚Äústream‚Äù you prefer but ultimately it‚Äôs dependent on the bosses to allocate you into. 

After streaming is where the meat of the training begins; Simulator training. This phase is specific to the stream you‚Äôre in. I am an Enroute controller so I did my ‚ÄúArea Procedural Course‚Äù in 2016. That took a hard 6 months. This course is the make it or break it moment. Those who did not pass the final assessment usually won‚Äôt get to continue as a controller. 

Once simulator training phase is over, you‚Äôll begin the On-The-Job Training (OJT) where you‚Äôll be working on live traffic under the supervision of OJT Instructors who will monitor and guide you towards handling live traffic while at the same time ensuring that no safety is infringed. This usually take between 4-6 months depending on individual aptitude. 

Once all that is done, you‚Äôll be given an ATC License and have the privilege to order Pilots around!

3) It really depends. 

After night shift is always tiring as we worked overnight, but it‚Äôs always nice to eat breakfast with your watchmates/colleagues and just chill for a while before going home to rest. 

For day duties, it depends on what happened during that particular day. If there‚Äôs intensive weather over the aerodrome that caused extensive delays and diversions, it can be mentally draining. If everything was normal and smooth, it can be relaxing and chill. 

Ultimately the entire training process should fully equip you with the necessary skillset and confidence to function to a high degree. You‚Äôll learn how to let go and relax when you‚Äôre relieved and not in position so as to be ready again when you‚Äôre in position. 

I would say that most days i feel a sense of accomplishment. Especially when i was able to handle a highly complex situation in a satisfying manner. Kinda like beating a personal high score. 

Also, the fact that i dont have ‚Äúback log‚Äù really helps to let go the stress when in position.",2022-08-22 14:56:10,NEU

ilbneub,"ATC has 3 shifts, AM PM and Night shift. 

My day usually starts of with a briefing by the managers on any key events that may be happening for the day as well as the weather forecast. 

After which I will then take over and relief the previous ‚Äúwatch‚Äù by going to their positions and receive a more thorough and specific briefing from them such as what is the current situation in the air, what tasks are outstanding, what‚Äôs the weather pattern. 

Once in position and in control, it‚Äôs almost quite ‚Äúgamey‚Äù. I‚Äôll climb aircrafts to their final cruising levels. I‚Äôll be descending aircrafts for their destination aerodromes. I‚Äôll be vectoring aircrafts to separate them or keep them clear of weather cells. I‚Äôll have to juggle multiple aircrafts from different directions with different destinations and different requests. 

Sometimes we have diversions if aircrafts cannot land due to whatever reason. Sometimes we have aircrafts who have to return due to technical difficulties. These are what we call ‚Äúabnormal operations‚Äù which are the ones that brings the challenge to our normal stuff we do. 

Career progression wise, it really depends. There are controllers who are satisfied with what they do day in day out and happy with the pay they draw which is enough to sustain a normal lifestyle. 

You can choose to go towards a more Managerial position but that would mean you loose the chance to stay in ‚ÄúOps‚Äù and thus working in traditional Office hours. Most controllers are quite stubborn and prefer staying in shifts than office hours. 

You can also choose to go to the Specialist route that is more caterer to Ops such as Search And Rescue, or Systems Specialist. However this track is quite new to the scheme of service and it‚Äôs still pretty much in the early stage no so there isn‚Äôt much information about it. 

I did not know what ATC was until just before Year 3 Capstone, when a dear friend of mine started his training as ATC. When he told me about what he was learning as an ATC, I became very intrigued and really wanted to try being one as the job scope was something that i really wanted.

>Do you ever get bored of the school food? Are there better and more food options near SUTD? (From the website it seems like there isn't much f&b services in SUTD considering that it has a small campus)

A little. It's hard to cook in hostel because of the general heat and the distance to the kitchen, but the kitchen's fun for when you want a class hotpot party or something. I'm not fussy with food, though - I ate the same thing like 3-4/5 days a week, with the other days being spent eating outside with friends. (i was also severely restricting my budget and eating cheap stuff...) I don't have much advice here besides saying that if you're a picky eater, CCP and CBP is going to be a lifesaver for you probably. though it might be expensive compared to canteen food.

>How is your experience living in the halls? Since it is compulsory to stay in the campus for the first two terms, did you face any issues during your stay/ do you have anything you liked about it (specific to SUTD)?

I really liked hostel. It's easy to spend time with friends, pop over for games, last minute projects, discussions, midday naps, all that. Though... some of the think tanks aren't locked and i know people who sleep in them away from the view of security...

>Is there any hall activities and if there is, how was your experience with it?

I think hall activities are bullshit. If hall culture is mass-organised activities we are doomed to generic icebreaker games and free food. Hall's a way to make meeting friends easier. stop trying to get me to talk to people I don't want to talk to.

>What is a few things you like/dislike about SUTD?

The fab lab is a HUGE plus. talking to friends from NUS, their ""fab lab"" consists of a collection of power tools handed down from generation to generation and 1-2 laser cutters no one known how to adjust the focus of. Being able to make your own things and knowing where to get hardware and materials? loved that. Stuff I disliked would be the puritan rules around alcohol; what am i, a child? (yes, i know there is some valid reasoning around it but at least treat us as adults pls)

>For those that had to go for additional summer classes, how was it and what did you need to do? (Since my rp was low, I was offered a conditional offer which meant that i need to attend to additional summer class)

Can't help you there, sorry. If you're talking about ILP, I studied the noted remotely after NS-related brain-rot and it was a little helpful.

>If you got offers from SMU,NTU AND NUS but still decided to enter SUTD, did you regret it and why?

Can't help you on this front. I was applying to yale-nus and they rejected me (maybe a blessing in hindsight) as well as NUS USP (also a blessing considering their fate now) but yale-nus rejected me and SUTD gave me a good scholarship before I could apply to USP. I got too much anxiety writing my essay at that point that I stopped and just went to SUTD. but in hindsight, neither place would have been as good at preparing me for industry as where I am now. yale-nus was very ivory-tower academia, i think, and USP... well USP might've been good, but it definitely didn't have a fab lab and the kind of social support that SUTD does when it comes to some of my interests.",2022-05-25 07:52:37,NEU

I'm an EPD student who graduated like 3 years ago (I'm doing software now if that matters at all) while CSD was still called ISTD.

Most of my CSD friends managed to land good jobs by / close to graduation, mostly as software engineers. Statistics from the school I guess should be a pretty good gauge of what's actually happening.

Regarding institution reputation, I actually haven't found a situation where that really matters. Chances are, if a company has hired an SUTD graduate before, they probably won't mind another one. I have had friends get hired from the work they've put up on GitHub too, so I'd think being able to demonstrate software design ability might be more of an advantage compared to good grades.

Lastly, I had an absolute blast in SUTD! While the projects and schoolwork can get quite overwhelming at times, there's always fun activities to do and people to hang out with. You'll start your education there with a common curriculum, which means everyone in your class attends the same lessons. You'll definitely be able to make friends and have a great time.

The thing with data science is that, are you interested in the field/industry, or are you interested in becoming a data scientist?

Data scientist roles generally require postgraduate degrees. With companies like Grab having around 40/60 of their data scientists being doctors (phd holders). 
Granted, a lot of companies now are using the ""Data Scientist"" name for bachelors, but many tend to be borrowing algos instead of tweaking them or going to the extent of creating them. (Then again, the goal is simply to meet the company's needs, so ML may not always be necessary)


I'd like to add that in SUTD, ESD is the more ideal route to become a data scientist (best is a mix of ESD and CSD, be it ESD major with CSD minor or CSD major with ESD minor). ESD has more of the math side and business application compared to the programming/theoretical side in CSD. Although CSD provides other options like cyber security, more towards swe etc.

Talked to a senior in DSA, he doesn't have that good of an impression about it and recommends me to head to Sch of Computing's Business Analytics instead. (He was from the original DSA, now with CHS, it'll be different bah). But then again, this could just be the ""grass is greener on the other side"" mentality.

I can't seem to remember what the career paths for DSA are (be it enter bza/data analyst roles, swe roles or postgrad). Will comment on this once I have it clarified.",2022-04-27 14:12:20,NEU

i0ld91z,"Hey bro! What I would recommend is going through a set process to prepare for the interview. 

Step 1: 

Go through the standard questions that most university interviewers ask? E.g why do you want to study here at SUTD? See the general structure of good responses to these questions, get a feel of how good responses are structured. 

Step 2:

List down your strengths (leadership skills, entrepreneurship, social intelligence) and tangible evidence for these qualities. 

E.g if you say you love trying new things and challenging your comfort zone ‚ÄúI am generally a more reserved person but I decided that I wanted to brush up on my public speaking skills, so I volunteered to participate in an inter school debate competition‚Äù. 

Step 3:

Do your research on the course in SUTD which you are interested in and list down the characteristics of the individual they are looking for. Look up the University‚Äôs general ethos and mission statement.

Step 4:

List down your achievements and do a write up on each of them. Framing each achievement in a way that lines up with the characteristics researched in step 3 

Step 5:

Rehearse in your head getting asked questions at the interview and confidently putting out your unique selling points as an individual (I.e team player, focussed, adventurous).  

I am was fortunate enough to receive the STEP scholarship from SUTD (architecture as main pillar) matriculating this year. Look up YouTube on how to ace interviews watch multiple videos to get a feel of how competent individuals present themselves).

I didn‚Äôt go bootcamp however, so just take this w a pinch of salt. 

Go beg your classmates for their notes or your roommate for your subject help. The profs in SMT are generally very nice and theres a good chance they were your T1 profs as well so go seek academic guidance from them as well. No shame already, just whack ba

When it comes to this exam, I would say that its (most likely?) a pass/fail exam so you already know you aren‚Äôt out there to earn ALL marks, just enough to pass. Find out where which topics are your boon and bane, work out a strategy and plan accordingly ahead of time.

Im gonna assume that you have a cheat sheet as well. What i did in my first year was that i literally plastered the certain steps of the ans key of my hw/rev of a certain topic idk on my cheatsheet, so i could just literally copy paste the steps on a qn (assuming its basic enough).

hynffor,"Hi! Pardon the late reply. Here's the reply from someone who's currently a Term 4 ASD student. 

""Generally, we have one core studio and one HASS (history, theory and culture) module for each term. The other two modules are a variety of science and technology courses, and digital learning courses such as coding. In our classes, we learn a mix of hands on architectural modelling and fabrication as well as digital modelling and analysis. In further terms, there will also be option studios where one can select modules that are aligned to one's interest or specialisation. The masters programme includes a 2 term structured internship and 2 terms of classes, summing up to a total of 4 terms.

As ASD is quite fast paced, we are kept busy with projects and assignments. However, on the bright side, there are very few exams, allowing us to focus more on our projects. Many of us choose to stay in the hostel for the convenience (e.g. we can stay on campus later, less ferrying around of materials etc), but there are also a fair share of students who go home! I know of many fellow classmates who are still very active in their fifth row CCAs, and quite a few have also taken up roles as various Exco or committees.""",2022-02-27 15:05:25,NEU

As for attending courses, for a pre-uni student, I would say that shows initiative on your part, and you can certainly talk about it (what inspired you to do it, what you learned from it, what you liked/disliked about it, any next steps, etc).

There's promotions, quick links, essential programs to downloads, etc

2. Can't reset / unlock your account? Server not operating? Probably using the old site that is still up for some reason. Use the EASE portal for that.

3. Outlook not working?
The webmail should probably still work. Log into Ease and you should still be able to use.

4. Account lock out? Use your phone to unlock your account via EASE
There is a button under ""Login"" that says ""Need help signing in"" 
U can reset / unlock there.

5. New phone who dis. 
If still have old phone, keep it to register your new phone.

Died? Just call / email the helpdesk.

You need to make sure that your level of interest in the topic is enough to fuel your motivation to go through 1 year of learning Calculus and Python/Rhino-Grasshopper programming because you only go into the Architecture major after 1 year of the common Freshmore modules.

but yes, fuck Sus world just S/U it if you know you have no interest nor prior knowledge, you can pass with just general knowledge (environmental shit, recycling, basic bio stuff, just like a HASS). 

3.007 tho, it's gonna be mostly group work and you don't want to fuck up your groupmates grades. You're in SUTD, you signed up for the group heavy curriculum, if you don't want to deal with groups then NUS/NTU would've been a better fit. It's also not only about the prototype building, but it's about the design thinking skills, experiences and friendships you develop along the way. Term 2 is a fucking fun term and so far my favorite term in SUTD so honestly enjoy it while you can, after term 2 things start getting less chill as your friends start to focus more on their grades and you get moved to different classes from your friends.

for me personally i hated the 3.007 class and individual assignments so i just fuck care and did bare minimum. However when it came to group work I did my best work so that i don't disappoint other ppl and pull them down.

as for why I think you should focus on 3.007 because the potential to expand on it and learn new skills is very real and by focusing effort on that project you also get a good grade (usually). Make ur 3.007 project tech focused if ur group allows then you'll benefit more from that.

1. Never heard of anyone not getting their pillar of choice, generally very safe.
2. Term 1 is fully S/U (pass/fail), however upon failure u have to go for bootcamp. Term 2 you can choose to S/U 2 out of 4 of ur mods. No more S/U from then on. Although term 3 is considered freshmore, u get to choose ur own electives.

You can check out the freshmore subjects, EPD (engi product) would see the most relevancy, however there r quite a number of math/computing mods. If I recall correctly, mainly the 2 physics mod and the Chem/Bio mod (its 1 mod), is irrelevant. The rest are math/computing or hass, which can be chill.

Compared to the other unis, u may not hv as many computing mods in year 1, but the math mods definitely dont lose out. Term 2 covers linear algebra and multivariable calculus already. Granted term 3 computing mod covers OOP, which is done in NUS' Programming Methology 2, and has abit of ML.

Head's up, from what I've seen, the SUTD curriculum is more suited for JC student., Its very rigorous and quite a few poly students may find it harder than the other universities considering you cover alot of JC content in freshmore (as mentioned about term 2 math, those stuff arent covered in jc, so most of the jc knowledge is already done in term 1, and maybe the term 3 probability/stats mod)

given that DAI is a new course, i think its best that you just join first and ask seniors how it goes. 
3. yea u r kinda right about the 3 sciences thing but i would say they kinda cover enough basics but they move fast. However, profs are rly nice and if u need consultation and help, find them fast and u should do ok

hp5vqat,"I just graduated, went for math bootcamp after term 1. Iirc results came out the Wednesday following exam week. They will mail those who are required to attend bootcamp as a notification. I remember the test itself being much easier than finals and I managed to do majority of the paper. Format for the exam was the same as finals (math was questions and blank space for working). I'm not sure about passing requirements but I believe passing (i.e. 50%) is the minimum. Don't take my word for it though - check with the profs. 

Isn't term 1 pass/fail? For my intake it was and my transcript just reflects all subjects for that term as 'P' (as opposed to the usual A, B+ etc). Around 20-odd people showed up for the math bootcamp. For other terms that were graded, I think you'll be assigned a C grade if you pass bootcamp. Once you go to pillar year, there's no more bootcamp safety net and you can score as low as a D. I'll leave you to work out what's the points in a D.

hnfvj8b,"Incoming SUTD student here, my info is based on my research, hopefully another senior can add on:  
1. ESD is abit like the IS where you're able to apply skills (design, analysis, optimisation), to various industries. Many core mods are analytics related such as ""The Analytics Edge"" and ""Data and Business Analytics"". Whereas EPD is more of the traditional physical engineering like mechanical, electrical etc.

2. From what I know all pillars are built on from the freshmore subjects, so no background is required. But being an engineering school, having a background in STEM is ideal.

4. You can add anything to the application, if u're targetting ESD/EPD, maybe some projects would be good (this is purely based on options, no one truly knows)

5. IB curriculum should be applicable to all Singaporean Universities, so SATs shouldnt be a requirement, but it can be a good addition to give a better gauge of your understanding",2021-12-06 09:24:03,NEU

hn7k1ha,"Hello! I'm an ESD alumni, although not in the data analytics field now (personal preference). I did not take the ISTD Data Analytics (DA) courses, so it'd be great if someone who with experience there could fill in!

Anyway, I had the same dilemma as you back in Freshmore, I couldn't decide between ESD and ISTD (the pillar that offers the CSD degree), especially since the Data Analytics track was newly-introduced in ISTD. At the time, a senior described it as ""do you want to learn the math behind it, or are you happy calling libraries?"" Tbh, I don't know how true statement that is, but I went for ESD because I wanted to learn the math since it's the backbone of data analytics. To me, knowing the math meant that I would know what I was actually doing, and not just randomly punching in some numbers and hoping for the best. (Though whether I succeeded, is another question, haha.)

Also, in ESD, it seemed like analytics was built into the core, rather than 'tacked-on' as in ISTD electives (again, would be great if someone from ISTD/CSD can clear this up). At a virtual ESD welcome session last year (to welcome the Term 4 ESD students), ESD's Pillar Head, Peter Jackson, described ESD as ""data science, decision science, \[something I forgot\], logistics, finance, \[more things I forgot\],"" and I found that it made a lot of sense. To be fair though, ISTD is Information Systems, which encompasses more than analytics, so it only makes sense that the ISTD core is not as analytics-focused as ESD.

I did have an ESD friend who took a bunch of ISTD data-related electives, and they felt that there was a lot of overlap in Term 6, describing 40.016 and 50.038 as similar, just in different programming languages (though there are still non-overlapping concepts taught in both).

Additionally, I think what's really important is picking a good internship. I don't have much relevant advice for this, except that you should look for an industry/sector you're interested in working in as much as possible; domain knowledge goes a long way. It'll also be helpful to start looking up data analytics job listings now, so you have an idea of what sort of experience and skills employers are looking out for, and maybe that could help inform you of your pillar choice.

Having graduated, I would describe ESD as a way of thinking (""design, analyse, optimise"") that can be applied to different industries/sectors. You can see this in how ESD's focus tracks are industries (aviation and urban infrastructure, supply chain, finance, and biz and OR), compared to ISTD's focus tracks being specialisations (AI, DA, fintech, IoT, cybersec, and visual analytics). Hell, you could probably apply ESD to ASD/EPD/ISTD/DAI/HASS/SMA.

If I had to choose my pillar again (wanting to go into data analytics), I think I would still choose ESD, with ISTD electives. Then again, I do have a biased perspective, so I would take my own statement with a pinch of salt, haha.

hi3ehxg,"You could matriculate early, and have access to some special summer programmes (SSP) that begin in May and end in Aug. You could take Term 1 Math mod ‚ÄúModelling and Analysis‚Äù or Physics mod ‚ÄúThe Physical World‚Äù, plus up to 2 Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS) modules borrowed from pillar years, that count towards Term 8 mod fulfilment (meaning to say if you take it during SSP, you can take one less HASS mod when Term 8 comes, and this is very helpful because Capstone that spans an entire 2 terms will be a real pain to deal with, trust me).

I went through SSP, along with several of my batch mates, mainly due to the delay of our official undergraduate commencement by 1 whole term from May 2020 to Sep 2020 as a result of the situation of the pandemic at the time of the decision being made by the university.

It definitely eased much of the pressure when Term 1 came around as i only needed to do the remaining 3 modules, having done 1 module in the SSP prior. Many will be jealous of you having extra free time (upwards of around 5 hours per week), but that being said, the 2D cross-module project would still require your participation though, so it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre completely void of any duties for the module you took in SSP. That said, the 2D component will only apply to your other 3 modules, and not the module you‚Äôve already taken before Term 1.

Some would say SSP variant of the Term 1 modules offered (Math or Physics) is a ‚Äúcheese‚Äù version, or a simplified version with better weightages and being comparatively easier to score.

These are my own personal observations drawn from the SSP experience. Feel free to weigh the benefits and opportunity costs of taking SSP.

You could of course decide to partake in part-time or contract work to bridge the gap between your previous endeavour or commitment, and the upcoming Term 1. I assume you are due for the 2022 matriculation cycle.

2. Personal Opinion  
Personally feel that it is up to the individuals to make the differences. Professors are quite committed, I must say. Consultation is q free flow. Lessons are mostly manageable. If you are the overzealous kind who wants to make a difference like in MIT, I think prof here are quite open to changes, you just have to propose to profs who are interested (I think simple email will do. Prof usually looks in the email de.) For research-wise, SUTD upholds interdisciplinar-ism, so you may not have profs who are very deep in niche areas of research, but I would say that what they research is pretty close to what the industry needs ba. Of course, if you want to make difference, not all are smooth-sailing. Just have to deal with failures and carry on if you see them as desired.",2021-08-27 12:20:25,NEU

h9dmes9,Oh ok. Then is our final gpa when we graduate university simply based on the grades of all the terms (i.e. all the grade points of all the mods we have ever taken in the 4 yrs added together and then divided by the total no of mods taken in the 4 yrs) or the gpa at the end of every term added together and divided by the number of terms in our 4 yrs?,2021-08-18 05:16:26,NEU
h9cijp1,"If you S/U one mod, the mod is not counted towards GPA. Say, at first you got 1C, 2 B, 3 B+ and 2 A-, that means your GPA is \[1 (2)+  2 (3.5) +3 (4) + 2 (4.5)\]/ 8 = 3.75. If you S/U the 2 Bs you have, means it is  \[1 (3.5) +3 (4) + 2 (4.5)\]/ 6 = 4.08

hint hint you s/u at the end of term 3.

It is true people use that. but bear in mind that if you get a grade below what you get for freshmore, this s/u will backfire as the weightage on your senior years is higher. For example, say you get a B- or below after s/u if you want to carry on the example above.

side note: the school implements this policy so that you can play a bit more in freshie and choing more in pillar, or you screw up one mod or purposely don't want to study that mod.

If you fail a mod, you go through boot camp, which is during your term break after finals. If you pass your Bootcamp, you get the lowest passable grade (C for freshie, D for pillar). If you fail boot camp(2nd time), I think you will get a warning and need to retake that mode next year or something, which is kind of troublesome, cus some mod in your senior year has prerequisites. So, that means a snowball effect or overloading or gap year. And if you fail one more time(3rd time), think you will get suspended or something. Then if fail another time (4th time), I think it is expulsion or something (I am not so sure, maybe it is the 3rd time failing then you get expelled)

It was a 1.5-hours test in an LT (or was it an hour long?), and if I'm not wrong it was basically a mix of GP Paper 1 and GP AQ, if you're familiar with the 'A' Levels. For those who aren't, basically it's an essay for us to discuss a given topic. (Though, I can't remember if a strictly argumentative essay was expected. But I don't think it makes a big difference in answering your question about what the EWET is.) There's no right or wrong answer, they just want to see how you argue and your command of English. I don't know of anyone who failed it, and I don't think you will fail unless your English is really atrocious. (That's what my OGLs told me at least.)

h4k8c68,"Hi, currently am phd student in sutd. To briefly answer your questions:

1) Research experience so far has been good. The school makes a lot of resources available and there are ample opportunities for collaboration.

2) Overall culture is friendly, though perhaps less close knit these days due to most people working from home. From the short time I spent in and around campus in my first year it was a very pleasant experience. The faculty members are generally really great as well, and are very approachable.

3) I believe all phds have to do at least 1 internship/research attachment, usually in the 3rd or 4th year. International internships might be hard to come by given covid though.

One thing I feel could be a very subjective matter is the size of the student body. Being from a very small pillar, we only have a few students every year and although this results in us being closer as colleagues and friends, it does result in resource pooling (i.e. sometimes courses are not available to us because there are only going to be 3 people taking the course if it were offered).

h4f3aot,"Just graduated from the PhD programme a while back, here are my responses:

**Research Experience:** I really appreciated the interdisciplinary nature of SUTD which not only helped a lot in building one's academic portfolio but also gave a chance to interact with people from specialisations might not even typically talk to. This is especially so if your advisor's research team is comprised of researchers or other PhD students from various backgrounds, which helps in understanding how others think or do research. 

**Faculty**: Most faculty are very approachable and willing to help or collaborate with you, even if you are from a different pillar. I think this is bolstered by the fact that SUTD is still rather young and have hired a number of recent PhD graduates whom are open to trying out new things in their career. In fact, I feel that most profs are open-minded and are more willing to share the details of their own research, even in casual conversation. 

**Hurdles**: That said, most hurdles which I faced during my research would be dealing with certain admin departments. In general, getting approvals for *certain* matters might take more time than you would expect, in a university setting, which might hinder your research schedule. So it's best to factor that in if your research is 'less conventional' than the norm, especially when charting your research timeline.

**Internships**: Depends on your pillar. It's more mandatory for EPD track, but less so for ASD. I'm uncertain about ESD, ISTD or HASS though. 

As for international internships, I guess this is dependent on your contacts and subject to approval from the grad student office. Of course, the one greatest obstacle is overcoming Covid restrictions right now since Singapore (and even SUTD) is rather conservative in dealing with this.

Hope this helps and feel free to DM me if you need more info.",2021-07-08 00:28:54,POS

h410wsy,"Hi, I did earn a little bit of extra cash during my 4 years at SUTD working simple jobs. I did tutoring as well as hopped on the student helper scheme (it's a closely held secret that the student helper scheme is a paid UROP).

1. It is pretty much a guarantee to be on the student helper scheme if you have a good working relationship with a prof, and demonstrate willingness to SHOW UP. Literally heard of too many stories where people signed up for UROP and list it on their portfolio despite only turning up for the first meeting. You need to specifically ask to be on the student helper instead of UROP scheme though. This pays 10/h and the number of hours worked is based on trust. I always submit a claim with a nominal 32h/mth worked. You can put up to 64h but I wouldn't recommend it as it may come off as taking advantage of the system.
2. You can elect to take an internship during both summer holidays, generally pay ranges from a 800 to 1.5k per month. As for jobs during the school term, some common jobs are
   1. Sales (insurance/real estate/MLM etc). Income mostly commission based, ranges from 0-10k/mth.
   2. Tutoring (1-1 tutoring jobs are easy to find. If you want to have more flexibility and ownership you may choose to do group tuition like I did. The 3 common forms of group tuition are via zoom, renting a classroom or getting them to go to your place of residence). This pays anywhere between 25-70/h.
   3. ecommerce. Anecdotally, my sister was able to provide for her expenses during her studies by marketing anime related merchandize online.
   4. Part time retail. Some of my friends worked at yoghurt/BBT outlets at an hourly rate of 12/h. I'm certain its higher than average due to my friend having prior experience or taking on extra roles besides sales.
   5. Food delivery. A more recent addition to the pool of common jobs students take, this also provides quite a good source of income as well as exercise if that's something you are into. The average earnings amount to 5-10 per trip.
3. Don't quote me on this but people who know me would know I spent about 10-15h a week on anything related to school =). The average would be closer to 30-40h though. Pretty much wasted my time playing dota for 5h or more a day. I'm sure there are a minority who also treated uni as a holiday before the real work starts.
4. Definitely does not affect your chances as a student helper at all. I was on the undergrad merit scholarship and was a student helper.
5. What? I believe you are asking on the general thoughts on earning money as an undergrad. I give my seal of approval and say it is 100% possible to earn and also grow your bank balance during uni. A word of caution however, I strongly advise against working in a part time job you dread just for the income as it would take a toll on your mental health.

Thanks for the interesting question. I did enjoy answering it and hope it widens your perspective on the available income options.",2021-07-04 14:52:02,NEU

We worked pretty well together as we had the INTJ and INFJ to keep the group on track and the ENFPs for idea generation and doing the entertaining stuff during presentation.

In term 2 I had an ENTP, 2 INTPs and we have me. No Js, so the group was really mostly the two INTPs doing their own thing, the ENTP and ENFP distracting each other instead of focusing in class (it annoyed me more because he's a lot more intelligent than me and can study while I really struggle with studying and focus), so the group wasn't as strongly bonded as previously as there was no 'glue'. I really liked the people individually in this group and ideas are great but the dynamics is not really great due to lack of grounding lol.

15.2, and by extension 15.3, exists to ensure Housing is able to crack down on more serious breaches, as well as for serious medical emergencies. This is especially true for breaches that also violate Singapore law. Rest assured that it is not a regular occurrence for housing to enter rooms without prior consent. That said, the terms and conditions will be enforced without exception if a student is caught breaching any of them. A more concise version of the T&C is posted around the hostel and freshmores will be briefed about the implications during the Discovery Week post matriculation.

Regarding prohibited items, anything in violation of Singapore law is obviously not allowed. (e.g. Weapons, vapes, etc.) Possession of alcohol is fine, but consumption of alcohol in the Hostel is a no no. To prevent doubt, sealed bottles are fine. Open bottles should be avoided.

Given the scope of some Freshmore, EPD, Capstone projects, storing (not operating) equipment in your room is generally fine.

Cooking appliances should be used at the pantry, not in your room, due to fire and safety hazards. Refrigerators can be used in the room, subject to application to housing upon check-in/during stay, as well as a small fee to offset electrical consumption. Regular inspections are done in conjunction with the regular air conditioning maintenance to ensure compliance and students will be informed via email prior to said maintenance/inspections.

Speaking of which, getting an internship is more of skill level, rather than relying on school to spoon feed.

gzy6w1h,"Life in SUTD is fun and enriching from the experience I've had so far (only been through Terms 1 and 2 as a Freshmore and now in summer holidays). 

One thing I really like about SUTD is how they encourage people to get along and work together. For your first two terms, it is mandatory to stay in the school hostel. Usually, you would be living on the same floor as your classmates. Being around the same space 24/7 helps to bring you and your classmates together. I know my classmates had study sessions together in dorm rooms and played games together in one of the meeting rooms nearby. Not to mention that fifth rows themselves (basically CCAs) have rather tight-knit communities that welcome anyone with similar interests to join in. So long as you aren't being a general ass (word spreads fast around here), it would be easy to find friends here. 

Workload-wise, I would say it is not so bad so long as you manage your time wisely. Homework and quizzes are submitted usually on a weekly basis. There is a substantial amount of content that the professors go through during class-time and you are expected to read up or view the lectures before coming to class. It is kind of similar to JC in that aspect, with the addition of loads of group projects.  

The curriculum however is still kind of new, so there were some issues regarding how they taught it and/or how the content given was not appropriate for our level. By the time if you choose to enroll though, these issues would be addressed so it probably would not be that big of a problem. Even then, if there are still any, you can voice your complaints to the professors or in the feedback forms they always give at the end of the term. 

Thankfully, you can seek help from either your classmates or your professors if you have any problems regarding understanding content. The professors are generally very nice and open to answering any of your questions (especially prof bernie he's so nice i wish he was my prof ahhhhhhhhhhhh #blessbernie). You can also compare notes with your classmates too and have study sessions together if you are worried about taking too much of profs' time (though like make sure the classmates you go to actually know their stuff lol). 

And that's my summation of how life in SUTD is like. For SUTD admissions, they tend to be more holistic as compared to other universities (at least in my opinion). It is an engineering school so you should be adequate or at least indicate interest to learn physics/math. SUTD is also about collaboration as well so being a team player is very important too. 

Not sure what kind of advice to give you so I'll just end it off here. Hope my rambling helps!.",2021-05-30 05:57:18,POS

gz29tjc,"Hi there! I am a freshmore so I cant really comment about ISTD. 

1. Lessons in SUTD are not really divided into lectures and tutorials. Rather, we have 2.5hr class lessons (class size ~50). Usually these classes will involve the Profs teaching content, as well as group discussions on solving some questions. The class is more engaging in that sense than a traditional large group lecture. In addition to the Prof teaching at the front, there will usually be another Prof and a Teaching Assistant walking around the class to answer any questions or doubts we have, which is a BIG plus for me. Profs are also very passionate to help and provide guidance regarding academic content and project consultations. Our curriculum also features a project for every module, so its very hands-on and design centric rather than just pure bookwork. For example, for a computing mod, one of our projects was to design mini games using the content taught in class.

2. For labs, it really depends on the module. For example, for Science for Sustainable World (Bio-Chem-environemental mod), we have about 2-3 labs in total, and for Computational Design Thinking (Python programming mod) we had 1 lab session. However, we didnt really have many lab sessions overall.

3. Every mod in SUTD has a project component. Usually, this is known as a 1D project, and takes up anywhere between 20 - 35% of the grades. In addition to projects, we also have Midterms and Final exams, each taking up about 20 - 30% as well. Remaining credit goes to homework/assignments (~10%) and attendance/class participation. It is important to note that the curriculum and thus the assesment in SUTD is very different from other unis, as Finals in NUS or NTU usually take up 50% or more of the overall grade, and not all their mods have a project component. 

4. We take 4 mods per term, and each mod has 2 times 2.5hr classes per week. While this will amount to an average of 2 classes a day, I have had days with 3 lessons in a row! (7.5hrs!!!) In addition, some mods have flipped video lectures that we are to watch over the weekends. Homework assignments are usually due the next week. The most time consuming part though, would be working on our projects!

One additional things to note about SUTD would be the fifth row (CCA) culture. There are very many niche clubs here, such as Electric Vehicle society, many robotics and maker clubs, and also the usual sports and performing arts clubs. The uniqueness is not just in the number of clubs, but also that all CCAs are very welcoming and they do not usually impose trials or selection criteria. We are able to explore our interests and take as many CCAs (as we can cope with hahha).

gz0qsvo,"Honestly it depends what programme you're looking for. The traditional sutd programme with the guarantee of GLP (Which means about 3 months in any of the 4 universities depending on performance) or the STEP programme with an additional focus on Entrepreneurship with a guarantee of 1 year overseas to UC Berkeley Extension, Silicon Valley and ZheJiang China with a fixed syllabus focusing on entrepreneurship (granted you can pay to add more mods).

If you're looking at the value of each scholarship, the school believes that the STEP Scholarship super seeds the Global Distinguished Scholarship. However I would not recommend going for STEP only for the small perks (like longer overseas trip etc). You'll be wasting alot of your time if you have no interest in it (not the mention the additional 0.5 years, graduating after the typical cohort). You'll overall save more money with GDS due to the additional $2.5k per term which is not available under the STEP Scholarship.

As a recipient of both the GDS and STEP scholarship before (Initially had GDS before it was replaced by STEP), I only made the decision to change after getting more invested in entrepreneurship such as taking the harvardx online course.

gyyjy5i,"Throwaway for reasons. Am an ISTD senior.

It's possible that this is only applicable to ISTD (and also note that if you're a prospective student, it'll likely be quite different for you), but I found the curriculum to be extremely disorganized. In my experience, SUTD's courses primarily operate on a ""shallow but broad"" basis, which has its benefits, but is a terrible strategy for a university. Many courses have huge overlaps in content with each other (which may be more a product of poor communication rather than the course itself). If you're interested in, say, AI, and come up with a study plan that's centered around AI-related courses, you'll just end up learning the basics over and over again. Some courses, such as Introduction to Algorithms in term 4, are lifted almost entirely from MIT OCW ('almost' not because they added, but because they removed some topics). In my opinion, most courses simply do not give students the technical rigour that a university should afford.

Design is the core emphasis of the curriculum, but after having went through seven terms of it - and this may be a highly unpopular opinion - it's mostly just fluff. 'Design' is integrated into the curriculum mainly by assigning 'design' projects each term, with the 'design' part simply meaning that you have to also produce a poster for your project. Don't get me wrong, good design is vital to the success of any product. But there is very little concrete teaching on what actually makes good design and how to achieve it for specific courses and topics; instead, the times when it's mentioned mostly involve cargo-culting around some abstract design processes and practices (""double diamond"", for instance).",2021-05-21 16:31:36,NEG

gyv7mfx,"Hi OP, stumbled onto this post many days late and had to leave a comment after seeing some of the replies on it:

First, let me address a few of the replies on this post. u/Any-Background-7568 mentioned that you ""dont need a degree to be a front end or full stack developer"", which is 1) not very true since a lot of jobs out there will still minimally require a technical degree qualification (less and less true though, which is great!) and 2) not very helpful since this can also be said for some other jobs that ISTD grads can go into such as data science and machine learning (lots of courses and non-degree bootcamps/qualifications for these as well).

Also, u/henlojseam said that ""Frontend development is more craft than qualification"" but I think he is conflating the roles of frontend/UI/UX designer and frontend developer - in VERY small setups, there are people who take up both of these roles but in most other settings, these roles are really served by two different specialists. However, I still agree with him that design skills are very useful to pick up for a frontend developer - at the very least, your developer portfolio can stand out from the boring masses.

Back to your question itself, I honestly can't say that ISTD is a good school to learn specifically about UI/UX/frontend based on the course offerings (only truly 1 course as mentioned by u/henlojseam). I do believe that NUS CS has more of such offerings, and apart from that they also have quite a few courses solely focused on developing software products from the ground up (CS3216 and CS3217) where you can play the role of a UI/UX/frontend specialist on the team.

But just to share a personal anecdote as someone who has graduated from SUTD and is currently doing front-end design and development at a startup, SUTD was the place where I ""found my calling"" (cough cough cliche lol) in this field - I realised my love for graphic design in the freshmore intro to design module, converted that graphic design passion into the field of UI design and development in one of the ISTD core mods (can't remember the name) where we partnered up with some corporate company to create a software product (also where I first learnt and used React.js), then really committed myself to this path afterwards.",2021-05-20 20:36:54,NEU

gyny39d,"Hello! I'll answer some of your questions:

1. No one knows, we'll have to see how the situation evolves and what guidelines the ministries provide. If the government calls for Circuit Breaker 2.0, then we have no choice but to follow that; the AY2019 Freshmores were kicked out of hostel when Circuit Breaker was announced, halfway through their Term 3. As far as possible, I'm sure SUTD will try to get Freshmores on campus (they were prioritised for physical classes, everyone else had to take a backseat), and if staying in hostels is permitted, Freshmores are guaranteed a room. Of course, you can choose to not stay in, literally the only requirement is paying the hostel fees each term.
2. No one likes a freeloader, most people will play their part, with varying effectiveness (some people come in with lots of experience under their belt, while others may struggle with the course content, so it's also important to ensure work is distributed according to everyone's strengths and weaknesses). Of course, there are bad eggs who don't do anything, but you can inform the profs and give them poor reviews in peer reviews. Regarding proactiveness, not everyone is a leader la, but most people will try to get their job done. I wouldn't say you have to tank, but you do need to learn to delegate and find ways to ensure people complete their work if it really comes down to that. But if that fails, then yeah I guess you'll have to tank.
3. Depends on what you find important. Personally, I'm not in any special programme, but I'm not interested in any of them anyway so to me, it's worth it. There are also other avenues to pursue research/entrepreneurship if you're interested in them, but I'm not interested in them so I can't provide any personal experiences.
4. Depends on what a ""good internship"" means to you I guess. If you mean big names, I would think that those are hard to get anyway. But since your question mentions ""as an SUTD student"", I'm guessing you're comparing between being an SUTD student and being an SIT (or other unis) student? I personally don't think being a student from any particular university gives you an edge (though maybe it can be argued that you do have an edge over private unis? I don't know), it's more on your portfolio and skillsets and even your personality. And regarding portfolio, SUTD has a lot of projects built into the curriculum that you can add to your portfolio and talk about in interviews, and that could help. But overall, I could be wrong about the whole having an edge thing, take what I say here with a pinch of salt.
5. As often as you want, depending on whether the faculty member wants to take you in or not. There's also self-initiated UROPs you can propose. Usually calls to sign up for UROPs take place in the first few weeks of the term, maybe even the preceding break. But it could be possible for you to hop onto a UROP after the registration if you know the faculty, but this is kinda a back door thing and by no means a guarantee of getting into a UROP or being recognised for it.
6. Don't know, I'm an average student who doesn't ask around for people's grades. In terms of bell curve, I hear different stories from different people, so I can't say for sure either. But what's consistent and quite known is that there's a limit on the number of A's that can be given out for any given mod.
7. I cannot answer this question satisfactorily.
8. Without having physical classes, it's a bit hard to say. The pandemic feels like it's dampened everything, but I feel that in all aspects of my life, so I wouldn't say you can take my word for it. But people are generally quite friendly, not necessarily extroverted. I guess it also really depends on the people you mix with; there are people who regularly go out for drinks, and there are people who are in the go-home club. I'm a relatively quiet person, and quite introverted at that (my social battery was usually dead by the end of Thursday back in Freshmore), and I think I'm doing okay with the few close friends I have. And even then, it's not too difficult to talk to my less-close friends or even acquaintances!

gynw3kc,"hello! currently a freshie at SUTD who just finished term 2 so i might be able to provide some insights but probs not super indepth. maybe some seniors can help to chip in!

1. we did have hostel stay from term 1 - term 2 last year cuz i think by then the covid situation was much more chill and singapore moved to phase 2 by then. so hopefully, if all things go well by the start of the sept term, hostel stay would still apply for freshies for the first 2 terms :). it‚Äôs probably one of the biggest highlights of my freshie terms so far :‚Äù

2. i would say that grp projects here r definitely much much more than what you would see in NUS, NTU and SMU bc in SUTD, every module would have at least 1-2 projects (be it big or small ones) bc SUTD believes in hands-on learning and collaboration as compared to the normal lectures and tutorials in the big 3. personally, i have encountered challenging teammates, but most of the time, the people within your grp r more than willing to put in the effort to complete their tasks. 

3. i don‚Äôt hold any SHARP or STEP scholarships actly HAHA. but i find it a worthwhile journey bc i think SUTD teaches u alot of soft skills through grp projects and all aside from the hard skills which r useful for the industry next time!

4. i‚Äôm not too sure about this. maybe some seniors can answer this qn! but i think that securing internships for SUTD students shld be quite manageable especially since our pillars r v broad and it teaches us skills that allow us to venture into many industries of our preference.

5. u can participate anytime! as long as there‚Äôs a UROP open and u fit in the criteria, you can participate. u can even propose your own UROPs that u r interested in during long vacations too (eg summer vacation etc)

6. i would say it‚Äôs not vv easy but if you‚Äôre willing to put in the extra effort, it‚Äôs definitely doable :) just that for students w little to no physics background, they might have to put in extra work for physics though! i think as much as the profs say that there‚Äôs no bellcurve, i still think there is haha.

7. i‚Äôm not too certain abt this so maybe some seniors can chip in!

8. i feel like it‚Äôs a mix actly! i have friends who r extremely extroverted whr they can‚Äôt go a day without hanging out w people but i also have friends who r extremely introverted and prefer to hole themselves up in their hostel rooms haha. i too am quite introverted, but i personally found no issue w making friends there (i‚Äôve actly met some of my closest friends there :‚Äù)) i believe that everyone is generally q open and friendly! as long as you‚Äôre not an ass or slacker, you‚Äôll generally mingle well w the community :)

In exchange for the subsidised fees you work for three years in a Singapore registered Company. You do not have to pay anything back if you complete all 3 years as per the agreement. In the case you wish to break the bond before the 3 year time period, you will have to pay an amount depending on the period of time you have worked in Singapore after graduation (amount decreases the longer you have worked). At least that's what I have heard.

In some cases the Government can allow a student to defer the 3 year work period. The student will have to submit a form asking for bond deferment stating reason (Ex - Pursuing Masters etc.)",2021-05-18 17:34:15,NEU

gyhjm0t,"Hello, I would say that u/huixiang01 has answered your questions quite well, especially since there's not so much to say, in a sense. It would be great if some alumni could chime in with their own experiences too, but that's really up to some luck that they see this post and have more to add.

Perhaps what I can say is that securing a job has more to do with a student than the course. SUTD provides a foundation, and the projects built into the curriculum will help your daughter build a portfolio (not sure about NUS/NTU). Besides that, your daughter could participate in more competitions, or work on her own projects, and that can help her stand out from other job applicants which would allow her to reach for better opportunities.

I'm not from EPD, and I don't know whether mechanical engineers are in demand in Singapore/overseas, but overall, job prospects is as much as, if not more of, a question of society's needs/wants as/than SUTD's curriculum. SUTD can train mechanical engineers, but whether these mechanical engineers are desired is another question, and one that has to be answered in order to satisfactorily answer a question of job prospects. In addition, what makes a ""good job"" would differ from person to person, so I guess it's a bit hard to answer that in super concrete terms as well.

gyhg0ls,"Hello! I don't think I'm the best person to give any advice here, but since no one else has said anything, maybe I'll give my two cents.

Some background, I'm an ESD senior pursuing the IS minor, with an interest in media and visual stuff. I also have zero idea what biz students study, really, so I will be writing mostly from the SUTD perspective and so it will sound very biased. But I'm not willing to talk about NTU biz when I don't know what NTU biz is, so I hope you can get some opinions from actual NTU biz students too.

You mentioned biz, sociology, comms, design (aesthetic design, and not necessarily design thinking, I presume), archi, and UI/UX. These definitely seem more HASS than engineering, but I think there are avenues to bridge the gap if you remain in SUTD.

In terms of biz, definitely go for the interview and see the outcome (which you did mention). If they accept you, that's one more option on the table, and unfortunately the one option I can't give any advice on because I really don't know what biz students do. If they reject you, you still have SUTD!

In terms of sociology, well I guess you can learn some of it in HASS if you pick the sociology HASSes to satisfy some of your interest in it. Perhaps you could do some sociology mods in NTU too, though I don't know whether you'll have unrestricted electives or whatever they're called there. Not sure if you've tried applying to NUS FASS again, but from the info you've provided in your post, it doesn't seem like this is an available option? If it is an option, that's great! Though I really can't say more than that haha

In terms of comms and design, I guess the good part about SUTD is that even in your pillar projects, you can still pursue some form of comms and design. For example, you could take charge of the posters, videos, and presentation slides in your group projects. (I would suppose the same can be said for NTU biz.) Whether these are suitable for a portfolio to secure a comms/design job, I would lean towards yes, but I don't know how far you can get compared to a comms/design student (or even an NTU biz student? maybe?), at least for your first job. Definitely, a portfolio will help you a lot, and you can try sourcing for your own comms/design internship too!

In terms of ASD, I would defer to ASD students because I can't say I really know what ASD is. At best I can say, I would think there is some element of design that you can pursue, so if you go to ASD, you might be able to pivot and pursue a career in design that is not necessarily archi if that turns out to be not your thing. However, as someone who values their sleep, the backronym ""Always Sleep Deprived"" scares me, especially if I have to pour those hours into something I don't feel too passionate about. ymmv.

In terms of UI/UX,

* ISTD offers [50.006 User Interface Design and Implementation](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/undergraduate/courses/50006-user-interface-design-and-implementation), a Term 7 elective
* DAI offers [HCI and Design](https://dai.sutd.edu.sg/courses/hci-and-design/), a Term 5 core mod
* If you're in ISTD (or taking ISTD mods), you can offer to take charge of the frontend for other mods' projects too (though whether your groupmates/profs will appreciate it is another story). I would say that it is more of frontend dev than UI/UX, but it's still something you can put in your UI/UX portfolio nonetheless. At this point I also want to mention that ISTD is a lot more than UI/UX, and I don't know how comfortable you are with programming, so do consider that as well.
* If you're in DAI (or taking DAI mods), you might not get as much of a chance to do the same kinds of UI/UX that ISTD allows you do. ([I'm basing this statement on my impression of the courses listed in the DAI course schedule.](https://dai.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate/course-schedule/)) However, depending on the exact project you do, you can still try to squeeze in more UI/UX considerations (since a user interface isn't strictly computer programs and websites, but also the buttons on a microwave and stuff like that), and supplement your UI/UX portfolio. Here, it's also up to you to curate your portfolio to appeal to prospective employers.
* Basically, portfolio is most important. I wouldn't say SUTD is the right school per se, but it is one that can help you build your portfolio, due to the sheer number of projects you'd have to work on. I have no idea whether NTU biz can help you build a UI/UX portfolio, though, so that's still something you need to further research on, if you do get accepted to NTU biz. (But of course, this statement assumes that you'd still want to pursue UI/UX if you go to NTU biz, when you could be pivoting to something else entirely.)

In terms of ESD, actually I think ESD math quite ok leh (I would say EPD math is harder), but this is coming from an average student who doesn't score great in exams, and also isn't doing an ESD focus track (I took two ESD electives, one of which had like no math), so ymmv. There is math I can't do, but it could be attributed to me not paying attention and not the difficulty of the content. Then again, it could also be attributed to the content being difficult and me just not being bothered by it, and therefore not being aware of it. But back to the main point of your post, I'm not sure whether this info is useful for you since you're interested in UI/UX, and ESD is probably not the best pillar for UI/UX. However, there are a few of us who are interested, and are finding ways to build our portfolio anyway, such as by enrolling in 50.006.

In terms of next steps, go for the interview and see the outcome. Also get insights from NTU biz students where you can. List down the factors that are important to you (eg. job prospects, ability to fulfil your interest in sociology, interest/ability in main course content) and assign weights accordingly. Then for each option available to you, assign scores for each factor, multiply by their respective weights, and sum the weighted scores up. Hopefully this can help you make a decision.

Also, I'm wondering, and maybe this can help you decide, what does NTU biz offer that interests you? Maybe what job prospects are there? Like I said, I really don't know shit about biz school, and I'm also wondering where biz school comes into the picture for you.

I admit this has been a very biased post, but I hope this still helps in one way or another!",2021-05-17 19:50:25,NEU

Yup, I do agree that if you relearn the things you learn, it is a bit sienz, but you will get pretty good grades in return if that is what helps your GPA. Maybe you need a good starting point... cus like.. it is gonna get faster after freshie with thick projects and fifth row commitment (if you have)

Also the thing about the fuzz. Same I also got that feeling. I interned before uni on web dev, but then i ended up in EPD doing mechanical engineering. Cus i slowly realised that coding is not a thing for me. So again, you got your freshie year to decide, so you can take it slow.

Sorry in advance if I sound a bit aggro, I don't mean to sound like that but I'm just wondering what's the point of going to school if you're only going to be learning things you already know? The point here is to learn isn't it. Also genuinely wondering, but if you're not ready to take on math, physics, and programming, then other than possibly architecture, why would you even consider this school? Physics and math (especially the latter) are integral parts of engineering and tech, so if you want to go into tech you really can't avoid it (especially math).

That aside, from my personal experience, I used to hate mechanics and newtonian physics etc and used to be really bad at them back in poly and sec sch, but relearning these concepts in uni is actually really interesting and i started to enjoy even though i still wasn't doing too well. IMO stuff you learn in uni is pretty different from pre-uni in that everything starts to make a lot more sense so it's really easy to start to appreciate the stuff you learn but your mileage may vary.

I think as long as you have interest and like working with people and projects you should be good. But then again i am only a freshmore so if any more senior ppl comment here you can take their advice over mine lol",2021-05-13 06:37:25,NEG

1. I am not sure about internationally and locally, maybe a search in Linkedin on where the seniors go might be helpful. But, we got like 90+% employment within the first 6 months. SUTD does have more job being offered than NUS/NTU despite COVID. For EPD, our pay, in general, is around the same as NTU/NUS if you compare apple with apple, say EPD with mechanical engineering. Click here for [SUTD](https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/post-secondary/ges-2020/web-publication-sutd-ges-2020.pdf), [NTU](https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/post-secondary/ges-2020/web-publication-ntu-ges-2020.pdf?la=en&hash=E430F2F55D9A8956592E402F4D348CC3FDBC5377), [NUS](https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/post-secondary/ges-2020/web-publication-nus-ges-2020.pdf). But it is not a case for ISTD, comparing with NUS Computing (if your daughter is somehow interested in computing after experiencing the first year.)
2. It is guaranteed that all students will have at least one internship, cus it is a graduation requirement School does provide a portal to provide the internship. Whether it is a good internship is a different story, and depends on the effort she put in, like if she wants to pursue a good mechanical engineering internship, then she should do more mechanical engineering projects during free time. Joining the fifth rows is one of the few ways to do so. Or do UROP too!

Lastly, may I know is it recommended to have CAD apps on your personal laptop? Or is it good enough to use these apps on the school computers?

My perspective is that sutd is the long term play cuz your exposure is really great. For me I have never gotten exposed to quantum so it was a paradigm shift! The design part and working with different people of different background was a crazy shift also. After term 2, i learnt so much about semiconductors and microcontrollers that I think it improves my understanding of the world.

gww4rox,"With a commonly known acronym like Stay Up Till Dawn, its not surprising what you heard. Given the large amount of projects every term, (1 per mod, plus 1 cross-mod, total >=5 ), 


It depends on:
1. What you define as getting to sleep (2-3 hrs or 6-7hrs?) 
2. Which period of the term..


1. Usually for myself, I get 6 hours of sleep on average. However there are some classmates of mine who spend a lot of time on fifth rows, suppers etc and sleep about 4-5 hrs, while others sleep up to 8hrs. For reference, I am a Freshmore that has 2 Fifth rows (1 sport and 1 music) and also participating in a UROP (undergrad research project). However its all about good time management which allows one to sleep more.

2. Projects usually start around the middle of the term. From week 1-5, usually its mostly academic, and less project commitments, so sleep wouldn't be so much of a problem here. However, after week 7, the pace starts to pick up. Content gets more difficult while projects start. The peak usually occurs at week 11/12-13, where deadlines of projects (prototypes, reports, posters, presentations etc) start to get close (due week 13). I would usually sleep about 4.5 - 5.5 hours during this period. 

Overall, I would say how much we sleep would be determined by our work efficiency, time management and commitments. If we were to take on more Fifth rows and side projects and participate in even more social activities, then sleep would no doubt be compromised (I onced jammed/karaoke with my band up till 3am and had 9am classes the next day). 
However, even if you do get less sleep, you certainly can get a more enriching experience of project based learning and lots of fun moments :)

gwvbg8e,"My time at SUTD has been defined by broken expectations and great disappointments. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the transgressions SUTD has inflicted upon the sacred academic tradition:

1. I expected to be able to enjoy 3 hour long lectures in a dark hall the size of a football stadium alongside 200+ other students (95% of whom are asleep or playing League on their laptops). Unfortunately, SUTD has smaller, more engaging cohort classes, which makes it too easy to learn concepts. The professors also care too much about educating the students... I want to be forced to self study in order to pass dammit!
2. I expected to be swamped by the loneliness of university life, with no light at the end of the tunnel as I struggled to wake up and go to class every day. Disastrously, the SUTD community is so welcoming and friendly that I couldn't help but take part in social activities and join various fifth rows to enrich myself. I expected to be backstabbed repeatedly by other students climbing the GPA ladder but (to my absolute horror) some of my classmates offered to teach me subjects that I was poor in. Disgusting.
3. I expected to be separated from industry and forced to work on stuff that has no practical purpose, simply because 'that's how uni is, accept it'. Instead I had to do industry attachments??? and internships with interesting projects and measurable outcomes??? wtf???
4. I expected good and cheap food. Unfortunately sutd food is trash.

Can't say I haven't had a bad experience with dell but I guess research into the serviceability of the inspiron or alternatives if you want it to last for your 4 years here.

Not sure about DAI given it's completely new, but from my understanding it is not as rigorous in AI development compared to ISTD AI track, if it will still exist lol. Going into ISTD it should serve you fine. Prob CPU abit underspeced. Am not in ISTD so not sure how much you would actually load your pc on a day to day/project basis. In freshmore though, if your interested to learn cad or the like for projects, you will need a decent graphics card. Don't think a mx350 will cut it. May be useful for computation later on.

From what I've seen, most would rather invest in a higher speced device with intention to use it for the 4 years, or end up upgrading their pc when entering pillar, ending up spending more. To save on cash in the long term (future proofing), my suggestion from experience is to go higher speced and for handwriting, go with a tablet either standalone or preferably, a drawing tablet from wacom (or cheaper, an entry level huion <$100). I don't think the digital note taking experience needs to be good, just sufficient so I wouldn't really invest unless you're into art.

Each week, there is a smol individual assignment to be handed up. Then there is a group assignment that is handed up about every 4 weeks or so. For more info, can browse thru [this](http://asd.courses.sutd.edu.sg/dti/) website to see our submissions n curriculum details.

Design also teaches some useful technical skills. Each week, there is a skills lecture. There are three types of skills lectures (illustrator, cad, video editing). Thought the exposure to these skills was p useful

It may get harder for the upcoming batches as the academic schedule is longer and SUTD admits more freshmores every year. It is just over a year ago that the decision was made to move to a new academic calendar, which I think we can agree is not enough to build a new hostel block XD Office of Housing is already aware of the impending need so we'll see how it goes.

The only hard criteria for room allocation is, as mentioned, the lack of disciplinary record. Failing to participate in sufficient events will not guarantee you won't get a room. You will simply be placed lower on the list, with rooms allocated to those that met their minimum event participation count first, depending on period of past stay. There are students allocated housing for failing this 2nd criteria.

We also touched on sampling and, by extension, estimators to guess the parameters of the population and how to determine the bias of the estimator used. Combining that given a certain sample mean and standard deviation etc, we learnt to perform hypothesis testing with various error types; Basically methods to determine how likely it is that this sample originate from an assumed population. Knowing that the sample is the ""real"" data, you will hence be able to quantitatively say if the assumed population characteristics claims are supported/rejected by these given samples.

gw08db2,"As you said. 3.007 is over. Don't fret over what you can no longer control and concentrate on your exams. Scoring decently overall is safer than having a single mod pull up your grades.

But if you really want to know, the regular assignments and participation would mostly net you a B (small sample size, biased perception blah blah blah). Anything higher usually depends on the 2D components and overall impression of you project, so subjective? But then again there are rubrics that are followed.

I had a similar discussion/rant with peers and Profs last year. As much as most scholarships only require you to maintain a 3.5 GPA, the presence of this requirement makes you focus more on grades than you should be; Instead of the learning experience and skills gained through projects. 

Personally I am also on scholarship and am scoring decently. But when having to choose between mugging for grades compared to doing a fun and time consuming project for the experience, I'll pick the latter any day.",2021-04-27 02:27:39,NEU

1) It does not cover hostel fees. The benefits of the scholarship are clearly stated on the relevant web-page on SUTD‚Äôs website.

2) I‚Äôm still in the second term of my Freshmore year, hence no GPA yet, but from what I‚Äôve heard from seniors, it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to maintain the requirement: 3.5/5.0 GPA which is an average of a B grade, which is thought to be the average grade given out to students. So as long as you don‚Äôt perform poorly/ sub-par to the rest of the student population, you should be fine. There are other safety nets as well, which you will find out in the academic briefing at the start of school.

3) I do not believe that that is the norm, although it has happened.

4) Haven‚Äôt got the chance to clear this requirement, but some of my peers have by volunteering with Open House preparations. But I don‚Äôt think it will impact your studies, 20 hours across 8 terms is not very intensive...

gttcu4t,"Stereotypically, if you get good grades and fifth rows records, it looks great to applying for programs in sutd, like an overseas program or taking minors.

But if you want to get a job, you must be wanted by the industry, meaning taking up projects that give an indicator that you have a particular set of skills.

But in hindsight, what do you really want? Would you mug all the way and get your first-class honors? Or have a decent grade and have a good life balance?

What is a priority? It is not really determined by the school. In fact, sutd allows you to make your own unique self, or portfolio.

Sutd kinda gives you quite a lot of opportunities. Officially, we got urops, honor programs, fifth-row projects, and whatnot, which is a low starting effort. Unofficially, you can kajiao prof or get from seniors/alumni if you make strong enough connections. Or rather, you will be pushed to make connections, and eventually, get what you want. Haha. In fact, that is what it is like when working outside in the industry.

So ya, maybe discover more, rather than being binded by the education system, as if it is a must-do to-do list curated by someone.

And ya, fifth rows can be competitive, but I don't think you need to be that competitive in order to secure an overseas program (more emphasis on grades)

And also, other fifth rows too, like, if you want to do more than just a member in your CCA. For example, sports. Why not join an external organization?

* Side note: maybe after taking lessons, you think that engineering not your passion, but your fifth row is, maybe you can also find a job after grad related to a fifth row. Some of the alumni did that.

2b. Why not? But during the interview, you must answer for it ba. The school doesn't make a resume for you. you make resume yourself. Also, make your resume that is suited for the company ah. Imagine you put a dancing fifth row in and you apply to a company that is work-centric like there is no after-work party. (in some company teams, people desire to choing home for family, rather than mingle with friends)

3a . Yes. Working while studying. I look at the comment below. Of course, you need to manage your time and have the competency, in order to have a part-time internship. I don't think a part-time internship is 9-5,  like it is because it is  a part-time? so ya...

b.  Independent Activity Period is student-organized workshops. You can be the one organizing or the one participating. I did participate in one of them, which is the ANSYS workshop, mechanical analysis for different materials in different forms. I did not know until the workshop comes out. Yes, it can be found online and learned online. Just like any classes, it is better to have a real person teaching you, so that you can fast track. Common workshops organized are illustrator, photoshop workshop for the freshie to prep for design or chatbot workshop so that you can experience to use cloud services, and also use it future events if you want to organize one.

1. ALP - asian leadership programme. It‚Äôs the exchange programme with Zhejiang U. For some reason it counts as an internship (I guess because we do research?) CDC - career development centre. They handle internships. 
2. Generally I work with cloud stuff. There‚Äôs a mix of reading logs, writing code (and documentation), and figuring out how to work new features into an existing system. It‚Äôs a good company in the sense that I‚Äôm learning a lot; my bosses are quite good at helping develop skills. It varies from team to team though, i hear. I applied for my internship with several projects in my CV: there was a forecasting model i made which tried to predict queue lengths based on several factors like weather, mrt breakdowns, and day of month. There was a recommendations generator for a salespeople (think like amazon‚Äôs ‚Äúother people also bought‚Äù recommendations), as well as other small things i did outside of schoolwork like making telegram bots. 
3. It‚Äôs not slack enough to fit another internship inside - i had some days that were freer than others for sure, but definitely not enough to add an extra 9-5 job in. Even a part time one, I doubt I could‚Äôve handled with the workload around exam time. While you‚Äôre at work, even if you‚Äôre an intern, unless you‚Äôve finished your stuff, you shouldn‚Äôt be working on schoolwork if you want a decent review or return offer from the company since they‚Äôre paying for your time. To be honest I don‚Äôt think anybody could juggle school and internship at the same time in sutd - not for more than a month ir two anyway.

gsondj8,"Hi! I just attended the STEP applicant day last week. It consists of 3 primary activities

1. Ideation/Design workshop (**1hr - 1.5hrs)**  
Essentially an alumni of SUTD STEP conducted this workshop using his new startup initiative called Rolljak ([http://rolljak.me/](http://rolljak.me/)) - its an online social game where people can interact and work on stuff, for example, one activity is an ideation activity where all students are given a   
keyword - i.e. magnet, and have the chance to choose another word, i.e. watch, and you have to draw something that combines magnet and watch together.  Other students can then add on to your design and finally, you can ""invest"" in the best idea.   
This series of events lasted a good 1hr - 1hr 30min
2. Crafting a Pitch (including Prototype/Mockup etc.) **(1.5hrs to 2hrs)**  
After going through multiple rounds of Rolljak games, they would have been done with teaching you various concepts that could be helpful for your pitch.  
For my session, we needed to pitch about education + covid19, i.e. come up with a solution for this.  
We are given around 1.5hrs to 2hrs to come up with slide decks, or work on any prototype (i.e. if you wanted to develop an app, you can use online drag and drop tools to build something simple to prove your point)  
(Not easy I know, but it is what it is lol)
3. Pitching **(1hr)**  
After you're done with your slide deck, everyone will take turn to pitch. They only allow 90s of pitching with 60s of QnA (super short imo)  
But after the end of pitching for each individual, students get to vote for their favourite pitch and that's the end of STEP Applicant Day!

1. Summer vacation is the time that there is no lesson, which is \*\*4 months\*\* That is when you do an internship. You can refer to the SUTD website, for the academic calendar. It depends. If you learn skills fast enough or you have sufficient skills, why not?  I personally feel uni internships are held at a higher standard, as I see from the poly interns in my internship. I dun get the last part of your question... is it like you don't contribute much and not worth putting in your resume? I think all internships are like that. It is for you to learn skills and show your competency. Learn as much as you can, treat it as a positive experience, and manage yourself ba. Don't be too choing sua.
2. Ah... you don't study or do projects during summer vacation for school, cus there is no lesson. But, there are many in school doing competitions, outside projects and what not during that period, which is not in the school curriculum
3. Uh.. some do cus they want to stay for the following summer internship (they carry on part-time). Many companies don't act want only 1 month, cus once you learn, it is time to go back school. Most part-time internship is carried out by ESD peeps, cus they free hahaha. Usually, people would attend various IAP, or before COVID, go overseas cus summer vacation is for internships. Or, just do personal projects. By winter internship, I mean it is 1-month vacation between the 2 terms.
4. Depends on your agenda. Do you want to experience different types of culture, job scope, etc. or do you want to stay loyal to a company, and believe the company vision? It is personal preference ba. If I would to stay in the company, I would consider, employee rights, culture, things to learn, mentorship, and $$$. cus it would be long term if I stay in the company.

1. What do you think is an ideal duration for internship? Do you think 4 months is enough to make a significant impact in the company you are working in (maybe doing a certain project given by the company)?
I ask this cos I heard that some internships are not really seen in our portfolio for job app if the duration is too short, because it implies that we did not do anything significant to the company. So I'm not sure what is a good duration.

2. Since your internship periods are about 4-6 months, does that mean you intern while study and do projects? That sounds very hectic!

3. Do you do unofficial internship during winter break? Why or why not?

4. And this question is a bit specific, but do you think it is better to intern in one specific job in different companies (e.g. do coding only in different companies so that I will have a lot of experience as a computer scientist), or intern for many different positions to open up our job possibilities?

Before uni: 2359media, chatbot intern ( 6 months)

After freshie: AEM Holdings, mechanical engineering intern (4 months)

Coming May: Dyson,  product designer intern for air wrap/supersonic (4 months)

Now, the school only officially gives sophomore and above official internship, cus they want a win-win situation (good image of the school) as they feel y1s don't have enough experience for companies out there. Last i heard ( in dialogue with senior management), the freshie went to source themselves unofficially. Frankly speaking, if one got skills and able to be chosen by company, meaning able to source, I think sutd should recognise them as official...

Typically, we intern in summer. That is where all university in Singapore have their summer vacation. Haha. If you choing sua enough, you can take unofficial part time internship, or unoffical winter internship.

* Note: official internships are recognised by the school and then counted as a grad requirement, while unofficial are not.

PT 3.  Around 1k-ish+. The point of internship is experience, not money. In fact, we call them internship allowance, such that if it is an official internship, it is not deductible by CPF. Yes, I heard of people having insane internship allowance, like 10k. That is extreme cases. Their skill level must be dam high.

Btw, if an internship does not pay you, it is a scam ah. If that happens, you must report to MOM. I heard companies doesn't pay cus covid, but it is still your money. Last I heard one of my friends' friend report to school, but school doesn't help her... So yup, straight to MOM.

PT 4. It is a graduation requirement. If you can't find an internship, or companies don't want you, the school will push you to some research internship in one of the automonous universities, and call it internship. With that said, it might not fit your portfolio when you go out and find job.. 

Yes. There are some companies require a certain GPA to get in just for internship. Companies including HP, DSO, DSTA and Dyson.(some require 3.5, some require 4 and above) But, I must say you must be a **correct fit** for the company. That means, the criteria are not just GPA, but also projects and attitude. I suggest you can do the projects you like and study decently well. (A perfect 5 with no portfolio is not a good idea)

PT 5. Like I said, you must be a correct fit. If you have high GPA but you do things that is unrelated to your job scope, no point hiring you. Take for example EPD. If you do so much Computer Engineering stuff like coding and what not, rather than Mechanical Engineering building the skeletons and muscles of the prototype and you apply for a mechanical engineering intern, it does not make sense for companies to choose you. They would rather choose one that is more relevant, proved to be more passionate on what companies do and have the same vision. So, you must prove that you are the correct person for the job.

* Note: how to know whether you are a fit? Usually there will be job requisites when you look up for job description, be it LinkedIn, Glassdoor, company website or school portal. 

Despite sutd being known for its interdisciplinary and its ability to adapt for a different unique skillsets, I must say that there must still have a certain standard of understanding and knowledge for companies to hire you.",2021-03-28 16:28:58,NEU

I won‚Äôt recommend which path to take but lay out some principles and other people‚Äôs experiences. 

First off, as mentioned above, your preferences will likely change as you expose yourself more to different things in life. The last thing you want is to sign on to something (be bonded) and then happen to find out that you like doing another thing.

1. Python
2. Rhino 3D & Grasshopper (I think, for Computational Thinking for Design)
3. Arduino IDE (Maybe)
- Random applications that I do not know the source of :P (at least for the old freshmore curriculum, mostly for chem/bio. Virtual Chem labs, or smashing flies after simulating mating cycles to study their progeny lol)


For EPD:
1. CAD/CAE. Solidworks Student Engineering Kit Licence provided at SUTD, upon request
2. MATLAB
- Mastercam (if you are into using CNC at fablab for projects, software provided on school computers but just to note. License not provided to students for their personal computers as far as I know)

Not sure what else, but it's mostly up to what your group does for projects based on interest/experience.

You can go with either Mac/Windows as there are always alternatives (fusion 360 instead of solidworks), but if you plan to utilize solidworks without the overhead of running a vm, then windows. Gaming laptops if possible, otherwise prioritise a decent clock speed on cpu. Dedicated graphics is basically a must (RTX20 series/30 series if you can afford it, GTX16 series is generally fine. It will serve you well for cad modelling and computation). Professional work will still be done on a desktop when you grad though.

Everyone usually will have to share their room with someone else, but I have classmates / friends that stay in single room.

Before shifting in in term 1, you will have to log onto the housing portal to submit a questionnaire / survey on your lifestyle habits (ie. What time you sleep, what time you wake up, you use fan or aircon, do you like ppl coming into your room or do you extremely value your privacy etc). The school needs this to see how to match you to a suitable roommate. 

You have higher chances of staying in a single room if you sleep super duper late (like 4-5am kind of late), or you can try writing to housing department for a single room due to existing medical conditions.

This is my experience so far; single rooms are still subjected to availability though (we are sharing the hostels with seniors as well so yea)

3. Locking your roommate out and placing turrets/traps at the door. Might require skills learnt in 3.007 or certain EPD courses, so you might need time travel to do so before freshmore (see Option 4)
4. Inventing a time machine, traveling to the time when the hostel rules were written and rewriting the rules. Consequences of using this option may include rifts in the space-time continuum, involuntary spaghettification or deleting yourself from existence.
5. Clone yourself, and have your clone apply to SUTD as well. There is a slight chance that you get placed in the same room, thus you will have the room to yourself. Again, option 4 might be helpful to ensure that you and yourself are placed in the same room.

What you described seems to be pretty much what DAI is targeting. If you are more focused in the product design applications with AI with interest in AI development, probably DAI is the right choice (pick ISTD AI related electives).

The reasoning for this is pretty simple. SUTD doesnt create ""specialists"". Listen closely to SUTD's marketing material and other curriculum materials, the term ""technological leaders"" or ""multidisciplinary"" is peppered throughout. There is a reason we don't call ISTD computer science (yet).  
SUTD believes that technology will disrupt conventional engineering domains, and there will be (already is) a need for technological leaders who are more than just good at one deep specialisation(aka major). That is why SUTD insists on a Freshmore curriculum and a Capstone project that involves multiple pillars. These are all elements of the SUTD curriculum that promotes understanding of a large range of topics and technologies, and equips you to be a versatile engineer/architect that is equipped to adapt in the rapidly changing landscape of tomorrow. 

&nbsp;

_SUTD prepares you to be:_  
_An Architect that can code_  
_A Mechanical Engineer that understands electronics systems_  
_A Programmer who understands bio-med technology_

gqgu2c1,"To answer your question, yes. There are a number of midterm scholarship options (SUTD administered and donor) that you can apply under SUTD.  

Applying for SUTD administered scholarships is really quite easy. Its integrated into the admissions portal when you apply. This includes special programmes, donar scholarships, and SUTD administered scholarship (merit,distinguished,etc). In fact, many of these scholarships do not only look at your grades but holistically.

&nbsp;

I do have an issue with how your question was worded though. I am not sure what background you come from (JC or poly), but there are a number of scholarship options in Singapore. If you just collected your A level results, you should have received a booklet on that irrc (its been awhile). Other than SUTD scholarships, there are corporate scholarships (bonded), corporate scholarships (unbonded), needs based scholarships (often provided by various foundations). A simple google search will let you know what options there are and what are things you need to consider.  

Now that you are in the wide world unshackled from the rigid chains of the education system, you need to take charge of your life. Its great that you are aware of the high costs of university education and are worried about applying for scholarships. Now spend some time *(hopefully alot of time since you are aware that applying for scholarships with poor grades isn't easy)* researching how to obtain a scholarship given your situation. Spend time reading the application criterias and asking questions to friends, family, reddit about specific scholarships and ability to secure them. Work on a good resume and seek recommendations from teachers/employers who are able to vouch for your positive qualities outside academic achievements. These are all hard work that you need to put in now that you are in charge of your life.

You are close to 100% guaranteed to choose your own major. I only hear once that one of my friends somehow needs to change major cus CDC screwed his internship? I do not understand the situation. But I think this is a very special case.  


No. SUTD chooses the quality of prospective students in the entrance application to SUTD. SUTD embraces a holistic assessment of the students. SUTD does a survey to plan out the estimated number of students for each pillar, so SUTD has the capacity to hold the different number of students in each cohort.

Ha! I just talked to someone on Reddit asking me this question. The answer is necessary. Take, for example, covid, to make a product for the nasal machine, we need bio knowledge. Or, if you are asked by the boss to lead (cus you have leadership potential) a team that is not your specialty, at least you have the knowledge to lead. In fact, the world is quite interdisciplinary.

The idea that students apply to a major isn't universal, and neither is it universally agreed that applying to a uni to study one thing only is ""better"". SUTD (or its board, or whoever decides on the curriculum) believes that the base provided by the freshmore curriculum enables students to communicate similar concepts.

I get where your concern is coming from, but I believe that is statistically unlikely. It is true that the ISTD population has boomed in recent years, while the ASD cohort appears to keep getting smaller, but I do not believe any pillar will be unable to attract even a single student anytime soon. Yes, there will be a strain in terms of resources for a more populous pillar. Yes, it might be that less-subscribed courses will be cancelled for a batch if there is insufficient interest (an example I can think of is one of the Term 7/8 ESD courses, which had less than ten people indicating their interest in it in an official survey). However, if a pillar already doesn't have that many students, I'm sure the admin people will be a bit more willing to have smaller class sizes. And I doubt SUTD would force students to go to another pillar if a pillar is seriously undersubscribed. I'm sure they'll find a way to deal with it unless they want to face some serious backlash.

And also, as I said in an older comment a longass time ago because I'm lazy to rewrite it:

>imo it is ridiculous to tell someone to go to another pillar that they may be even less interested in just because they have poorer grades and that pillar is less subscribed, and this may possibly signal ""hey this pillar is less worthy than this other pillar"" which is Not Cool

The pillar has some compulsory core modules which teach basic CS stuff like software development, basic computer engineering, algorithms, etc. The more advanced modules are up to the students to select. For the AI track, there are some compulsory modules like machine learning and AI. There are some other modules which teach things like data mining/data visualisation and then there are specialist courses teaching specific fields in AI: computer vision and natural language programming. Just for reference, I took machine learning, computational data science, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing and artificial intelligence in my 6th, 7th and 8th terms.

I believe the new AI pillar's focus is more on the thinking involved in the design and implementation of AI systems. If you take a look at the programme breakdown you will see there is a greater focus on non-CS related areas. Not sure if they added mobile dev modules but they didn't have those when I was a student.

1. No Letter of Warning (LOW)/Notice of Breach (NOB). This is pretty much the major factor. Breaking Safe Distancing rules/any other major offence is the sure fire way to get one
2. Hostel event attendance. It is meant to be non-competitive and it's 1/term. So if you are offered 3 terms of stay (incl Summer if you applied for it), you are required to participate in min 3 events. If you are a freshmore in the new acad system, it's Term 1 and 2 stay, so 2 events. You will not be given an advantage for anything more than your required number. But then again, events are for the fun of it.
3. Distance you stay from campus, measured by time taken using public transportation. However, the hostel houses both undergraduates and graduates, as well as SM2 students. It is meant to provide a place to those that truly need it.

There is an appeal process if you do not get a place, with strong justification. Alternatives are to rent a place nearby, usually with friends; That's usually pretty rare for someone with local address though.",2021-02-06 02:21:40,NEG

The design stuff are tied to the engineering modules. So if calculus and math stuff scares you I suggest avoiding SUTD and look for a different course. Architecture students who come here for architecture via poly usually got rekt in the first year. I'm not a shill üòÖ. If math is second nature the course material wouldn't be too bad. The only design course is introduction to design. 

You will get rekt in the first year if you didn't take A level subjects because most of it is an extension of a level subject materials (Chem, Bio, Physics, Math).  The time frame is pretty short so unless you can learn quickly you'll likely get rekt if you came from poly because the material would be 100% new. It's forgiving in the 1st year as you can use the term breaks to take makeup exams and get a low pass ""C"".

gkheekv,"Simple response for you.

1. Nope but you can influence the type of roommate you want to get as there's a survey on your living preferences to better pair two of you up. SUTD Housing definitely has a way of doing a good (but not too great) pairing. Of course there's a chance you do not get the luck of the draw, as with some of my classmates who gripe about their roommate.
2. Very common, unless you choose not to go home. The workload is manageable enough to accommodate fam time on weekends, just have to be super diligent and efficient in your work ethic to avoid slipping behind or en route to failing your important tests, quizzes and assignments.
3. Depends on your classmates and level mates. Some, myself included, can't be bothered to cook, and just rely on canteen food, or SUTD's restaurants, or head out to Changi City Point / Tampines Mall / Tampines1 for some good food (if time permits). But I know of many who have the time to cook at the communal kitchen (found in all 3 hostel blocks, 55, 57, 59, at the first level just opposite the Laundry Room). They've got ovens, actual stoves, basins, vending machines selling snacks, and then lockers to keep your possessions safe.
4. Toilet is cleaned up to 6 times a day on weekdays, and zero times on weekends (from my block's experience). For floor 12 at least, it's 8am 10am 1pm 5pm 7pm. So for other floors, I'd reckon give it a plus minus 45 minutes from the said timings. It's clean for floors occupied with less residents (basically Floor 12), but I cannot say the same for the other floors as there's easily 50 over people using the toilet. Each floor's toilet has 6 toilet bowls, 6 shower cubicles, 4 basins, and no urinals (yep no urinals cause the gender occupying the floors can change with each year).
5. Quite easy. Laundry used to be activated by ezlink tapping. However, the provider has since switched to PayNow QR. It's just a dollar per wash (regardless of washer or dryer machine). There's 8 washers and 8 dryers in each laundry room. As for drying clothes, you can just use the drying cabinet located in your hostel room (it's hidden behind the whiteboard which is actually a door in itself). For larger laundry items like bedsheets, I recommend putting it through the dryer, or hanging at level 12 (but the hanging area is not protected from rain so just keep that in mind).",2021-01-24 02:22:12,NEU
gkhcji5,"Hi. I'm a 2020 Freshmore here so I'm in an honoured position to advise you on the new curriculum, that was brought forward from the planned 2022 implementation to 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

**Term 1 (all modules enjoy Pass/Fail status meaning they aren't factored into GPA)**

* **Single Variable Calculus Math (Modelling and Analysis)**
* **Mechanical and Thermodynamic Physics (Physical World)**
* **Rhinoceros Software Archi Design + Python Coding Computing (Computational Thinking for Design)**
* **Humanities (either the economics-based Theorising Self, Society and Culture, or the literature-based World Texts and Interpretations ‚Äì the economics one is arguably easier than the literature one, so pray you get the literature one in Term 1)**

***Personal Evaluation: The easiest mod by far would be the computing mod, as it's designed to pass everyone regardless (based on my batch's experience). Next would be Humanities (if you get the literature one) as it's comprised only of 3 important assignments and there's plenty of time to complete (we're talking 3 to 4 weeks of lead time). Physics is easier than Math in terms of visualising and conceptualising I'd say, but that's just my viewpoint. Your perspective may differ from mine depending on your academic strength.***

In Terms 2 and 3 collectively, students may choose 2 of 8 modules to be set to Pass/Fail status. In Term 3, students will be able to choose 2 modules from a selection of 4 electives, as part of a pilot programme to give students greater flexibility and freedom of choice to pursue their diverse interests.

**Term 2**

* **Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra** **(Modelling Space and Systems)**
* **Electricity, Electromagnetism, Quantum Physics (Technological World)**
* **Chemistry and Biology (Science for a Sustainable World)**
* **Term-long Design (Introduction to Design)**

**Term 3**

* **Humanities (if you got the literature one in Term 1, you'll get the economics one here; vice versa)**
* **Probability and Statistics Math (Modelling Uncertainty)**
* 2 Electives (choose from 4 electives)
