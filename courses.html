Prof. Dawn Tan



In this course, we cover an overview of engineering management including topics such as financial principles, technology strategy, and best management practices. A key focus of the course is the development of individual skills and team work in scenarios commonly encountered in engineering decision making. Some of the case studies covered include semiconductor, technology and airline companies.

To provide exposure to key principles and practices used in engineering management, and to provide opportunities to analyze cases in the management of innovation.







Class participation will be graded based on the following:



At the start of the semester, there will be a session on group formation. Every student will need to submit an idea for a new business. Students will then have a “speed dating” session to promote their idea to other individuals, one on one. The best ideas will then work to form teams of five to six students to work on the following two projects for the rest of the semester. Groups will also have to develop a complete business plan for the selected idea as part of the second project for the course.



No prerequisites, but this course requires that you do the assigned readings and prepare for case studies before attending class. A sizeable part of your grade comes from class participation, and interactive discussions during class are expected. Analyses of case studies are usually due at the start of class on the day the case study is discussed. Doing the assigned reading is expected to facilitate meaningful discussions during class.

As in any engineering company, solving a problem often requires the input of several individuals with different skill sets. Therefore, the discussion of case studies is encouraged within the project group. Students however need to write up their answers on their own and in their own words. If you use work from other sources, these must be properly cited.


For certain case studies, individuals familiar with the case at hand will be invited as guest speakers at these sessions. Engaging the guest speakers with questions and meaningful discussions about the case studies will form an important component of your participation grade.

Prerequisites</p><h2>01.114 Instructional Design of Serious Games for Healthcare</h2><p>To recognize the importance of an instructional design approach to serious game design.
To discuss how learning, motivational and behavioural theories support the use of games for learning.
To explain the design and development cycle for serious games.
To review key technologies to support the development and deployment of serious games.
To design, develop, and evaluate a serious game prototype using an instructional design approach.
To critically appraise the Serious Games Design Assessment Framework (SGDA).
To discuss current serious game research, in particular for healthcare applications.
Like any other instructional solution, a game should be carefully designed, developed, and implemented to facilitate learning. The goal of a serious game is not only to create an immersive and engaging experience for learners, but to help them achieve specific learning outcomes. Game designers have a strong understanding of game goals, core dynamics, game mechanics and game elements. But this does not guarantee the success of a serious game if designers do not possess solid instructional design skills and work closely with domain experts. This course starts with an introduction of what serious games are, followed by a review of the motivational, learning and behavioural theories that support the use of games in education. Students will then learn about the design and development cycle for serious games, including game design fundamentals, with a focus on iterative design, development tools, key technologies, playtest and the need for rigorous assessment and evaluation. This course takes an evidence-based approach towards information that comprises critical thinking about, and critical reading of information to review what research says about current serious games, particularly for healthcare applications. It will provide a hands-on experience for students to gain the basic skills and know-how for serious games development, through practical workshops, and a design and development project. At the end of the course, students will be competent to execute a well-informed, evidence-based approach towards the instructional design and development of a serious game.

“Philosophy will have conscience of tomorrow, commitment to the future, knowledge of hope, or it will have no more knowledge.”
– Ernst Bloch
All of us are constantly dreaming. We dream of what we have, what we want, and what we fear. As thinking things, we dwell among potential futures and alternative pasts so that we can make sense of the present. Sometimes these dreams come alive and venture beyond ourselves to encompass friends, family, and society. As they unfold, they can crystallize into new worlds that are as vivid and refined as anything real. But at their heart, even the most elaborate of these imaginary worlds is still a dream, an internal reflection on what we have, want, and fear.

The world of literature is a gateway into the dreams of humanity. By reading great works, we can delve into some of history’s greatest minds and reinhabit and revive the forgotten worlds of their imagination. We can learn a lot about their cultures and societies by how they envisaged alternative versions of themselves, whether better, worse, or just different. But more importantly, we learn truths about ourselves and humanity by encountering profoundly different ideas of how to be a human being. Reading the writings of others directs us to rethink our immediate future in the world at hand. What do we have? What do we want? What do we fear?

In this course, we will read classic works of world literature and philosophy from the last two and a half thousand years that imagined radically new worlds and ways of living. Some of these will be utopias, better worlds, some will be dystopias, terrible worlds, and others will be something in between. But all will ask us important questions about our common humanity and the irrepressible power of our imagination to think critically about the world and society around us.

This class surveys the social, economic, and political change that societies and cultures have experienced from the year 1400 to the present. Its primary theme is exchange, or the nature of interaction between communities as barriers of distance have succumbed to curiosity and new communications technologies. Among the key issues the course covers, is the unexpected rise of Western Europe and the United States during the past 500 years, the “great divergence” in material, political, and technological development that occurred between Western Europe and Asia after 1750, and the resulting impact on the rest of the world.

The course presents history in an integrative fashion, examining processes, trends, and environmental factors at the trans-regional or global level rather than presenting a series of histories of different regions in sequence. It seeks to accomplish this by emphasizing the material, cultural, and intellectual exchanges that have taken place between different regions, societies, and civilizations. In the process, the class will examine a series of ever-shifting relationships, those between human beings and their physical environment, between different religious and political systems, between ethnic groups, and between men and women. The comparative study of these relationships will play a crucial role in illustrating major patterns in history. This course will also serve as an introduction to historical and other interpretive methodologies, as students will be expected to analyze and interpret both primary and secondary source materials.
At the end of the term, students will have the:

Instructor</p><h2>02.104TS The History of International Development in Asia: The Role of Engineers and Designers</h2><p>This course is an introduction to the history of international development in Asia that focuses on the role of designers and engineers in that development. Scholars in various fields have recently begun highlighting the deep social and political effects of development projects initiated by foreign governments and international agencies across the globe. The idea that designers and engineers are simply neutral actors delivering technical solutions to practical problems is thus no longer tenable. As such, this course asks, “What part have designers and engineers played in shaping the social, political, and economic transformations that have taken place in Asia during the past 100 years?”

Though mainly historical, the course draws on research from the fields of science and technology studies, anthropology, and development studies to introduce key concepts in the theory and practice of international development. The course also encourages practical exercises and cases studies in order to help students synthesize historical knowledge and contemporary design and development concerns.

Instructor</p><h2>02.121DH The Question of Being</h2><p>Acquire knowledge of some central, abiding philosophical problems.
Cultivate skills in reading/writing and speaking on the one hand, reasoning/evaluating and reconstructing on the other.
Learn to reconstruct and evaluate philosophical arguments.
Deliver clear, effective oral arguments.
Students will undergo one oral examination to be conducted by the instructor. The aim of the oral examination is to prompt in students the development of communication skills through the mastery of a complex vocabulary. They will have to demonstrate to be able to use in a conversation sophisticated concepts, while at the same time to demonstrate knowledge of the subject at hand.
In addition to occasional quizzes, students will take one final written examination to assess their assimilation of the texts studied and the material delivered in lecture.
This course is centered on the question of being. What do we mean when we say that something “is”? Or more abstractly, what is being? This question has been at the center of philosophical enquiry since the inception of Greek thought, and is the basis upon which Plato’s and later Aristotle’s speculations developed, which then served as an unavoidable point of reference and confrontation for any subsequent thinker. The question regarding being and the possibility of knowing it through our mental categories is the backbone of Western philosophy. For, it is on the basis of this question that the concept of truth as “adequation of thing and intellect” has been shaped in Western philosophical tradition. This particular understanding of what truth is finds its inceptions in Aristotle’s investigation of being to then reach its most mature formulation at the dawn of modern philosophy: it is then that the reciprocal relation of man to being as one of subject to objects comes to the fore. This concept of truth has since Descartes served and still serves as the ground for the sciences and their approach to reality. The 20th century, however, has seen a challenging questioning of the subject-objects relation of man to being as handed down by tradition: the works of Martin Heidegger represent a provoking re-proposition of the question of being and hence of the question of the essence of truth. Is the relation between man and being reducible to the scheme of subject-objects? What does it mean to truly know what being is? This course aims at guiding the students through the history of this central question – “what is being?” – which, given its pivotal role in the subsequent development of Western thought, can serve as an introduction to the history of philosophy specifically, while more generally at the same time as an opportunity to pose some questions regarding the understanding of reality that guides our techno-scientifically minded world.

Chairman Xi Jinping revealed a “One Belt, one Road” a year later.  While students are familiar with such buzzwords, our airwaves are being saturated by numerous talking heads expounding on such issues, what do they really mean? How has this come about? What is the historical back ground for such broad policy doctrines? Indeed, what shapes the Asia Pacific historically is not well understood. It stands to reason that an elective on the history of International relations in the Asia Pacific- East Asia should be taught in SUTD.</p></p><h2>02.128DH Classical South and Southeast Asian Literature and Art</h2><p><p>This course is an introduction to the artistic traditions of South Asia, focusing on literature, sculpture and painting. While the course will introduce students to classical Indian theories of aesthetics, that is, ideas about beauty, it will focus more broadly on answering universal questions about how and why we find art beautiful. You will be introduced to some of the canonical works and genres of South Asian literature, alongside the art and architecture of the period and/or region in which the various pieces of literature were composed. Though we will be looking at art in the distant past, the assignments are not historically based. Rather, you will be encouraged to explore South Asian literature and art as independent, aesthetic objects and, if you wish, as part of your assessment, you can choose to compose your own contemporary works of art using traditional South Asian ideas of beauty. In order to find further inspiration for our artistic explorations, during the course we will make a number of field trips to a temple, a museum and, hopefully, an artistic performance.</p></p><h2>02.132DH Being and Time</h2><p><p>This course aims to introduce students to Martin Heidegger’s Being and Time and why it is arguably the most important philosophical book of the 20th century, which has influenced and informed subsequent philosophical reflections. The course will teach students analytical skills of a philosophical text through close reading of the titular text, with the aid of H. Dreyfus’s commentary on it, Being‐in‐the–World. A Commentary on Heidegger’s Being and Time and a few other supplementary texts.</p></p><h2>02.135HT The Question of Technology</h2><p><p>The era of technology in which we live has widened the gap between Man and Nature. This divergence is particularly evident in the dichotomy man-made vs. nature-made. At the core of this dichotomy we find “making”, something whose meaning we take for granted, but which in truth remains enigmatic. What is making? What happens when the human being does something? How is the human being able to make anything? What is the relation between making, the human being and the world? These questions have occupied the entirety of the Western philosophical tradition since its inception until today. They are particularly relevant today, when the development of ever more sophisticated and complex machines is making so that human activity be unneeded or irrelevant in many domains.</p></p><h2>02.137DH Introduction to Digital Humanities</h2><p><p>This course is an introduction to the principles and methods of digital humanities, an emerging interdisciplinary field that seeks to apply digital and computational methods to investigations in the humanities. The course will focus on how computational methods and tools can contribute to the interpretive activities that typically constitute humanistic inquiry, especially to the reading of textual matter as literature. Students will be acquainted with the history of the emergence of the digital humanities and will learn about the leading methodological and epistemological issues in this emerging field. They will also learn about a few classic case studies in the field. They will also learn about the capabilities as well as limitations of computational tools for interpretation, and carry out a hands-on collaborative project as part of coursework using some of the methods that they will learn about.</p></p><h2>02.140TS Shaping Futures: Innovation, Work and Society</h2><p>Identify and describe processes of innovation from relevant sociological and organisational/STS perspectives.
Apply principles from social, cultural, and economic factors of work and innovation in the micro and macro real‐life context.
Gain insights into the role of individual agency in the areas of work and innovation.
Connect sociological and organisational/STS theories to real life and evolving examples of work and innovation.
Present a deeper understanding of how technologies develop, evolve and disrupt social and business processes.
Use major theoretical insights in organisational sociology and STS to study innovation.
Gain insights into the roles played by individuals and organisations in innovation, new work cultures and entrepreneurship
Be an engaged participant in discussions by analysing and synthesising information presented in the lectures and readings
Exhibit the ability to critique and apply relevant concepts and theories in written assignments and presentations.
This course examines the social, economic, and cultural contexts of work and innovation. It looks at the relationships and connections that inspire technological change within social groups such as teams, workplaces, maker spaces, and entrepreneurial ventures. The course is intended to cut across disciplines and appeal to students who have a broad interest in learning about corporate cultures and innovation processes of the 21st century. The course will emphasize social relationships surrounding innovation, the diffusion of new ideas and technologies, and relevant global challenges such as talent migration and outsourcing.

Instructor</p><h2>02.143DH Artificial Intelligence and Ethics</h2><p><p>The advances in the development of the so-called Artificial Intelligence (AI) have started to raise ethical problems. These problems are of different kinds: on the one hand philosophers and scientists have started asking whether computers, once they reach a certain level of intelligence comparable with human beings, should be granted certain rights. On the other hand, there is the question of how to regulate AI in such a way that, in the pursuits of its goals, it be harmful to human beings.</p></p><h2>02.144DH Being in the World: from Homer and Heidegger to A.I.</h2><p><p>A.I. is the new frontier of technological progress. But far from being just another tool, A.I. has the potential to change the way in which we relate to the world and in which we understand ourselves. Yet, A.I. remains a human product and as such it is the result of a certain way in which human beings have interpreted themselves and the world through the course of history. In relation to this long cultural path, A.I. represents one of the possibilities through which the human being can relate to things and to itself.</p></p><h2>02.146 Financing Cities of the Future: Theory and Practice</h2><p><p>This course provides students in technology and design with comprehensive knowledge on finance for urban development and management by introducing a range of terms, vehicles, instruments, schemes, and implementations along theoretical frameworks and real-world scenarios. The entire course work consists of three large sections: (I) public challenges; (II) private initiatives; and (III) social technologies. This means that the topics of urban finance covered by this course are not only the fundamentals of conventional government finance for public resource allocation, social wealth distribution, and market stabilization (e.g., market failures, public goods, tax policy, intergovernmental transfers, fiscal decentralization, and interjurisdictional coordination) but also the advancements of unconventional corporate, entrepreneurial, and social finance for competitive and sustainable urbanization (e.g., project finance and public-private procurement strategy, international financial markets and institutions, urban climate and green finance, land marketization and land value capture, real estate investment and asset securitization, and financial technology).  The course takers are expected to acquire both hard and soft knowledge on urban finance through a few basic analytical exercises and international case studies for broader social applications and cooperative actions across sectors.</p></p><h2>02.147TS Interventions in Design, Technology, and Society</h2><p><p>In recent years, growing attention has been given to the social, cultural, political and economic consequences of design by both practitioners and social scientists who study technology. However, concern about social impacts usually appear very late in the design process, or only after unexpected consequences occur. “Interventions in Design, Technology, and Society” hopes to change this by introducing students to important theoretical tools and conceptual frameworks developed in the social sciences. Students will use these tools to uncover the economic, political, and other forces that shape the design process, explore how values and norms are built into technologies, track the effects of technologies on society, and use these insights to experiment with, and hopefully improve, design practices and outcomes. The goal is to enable social scientific reflection on and redirection of design practices at an early stage of technological production. Accordingly, the course is organised along important social scientific concepts, for example ‘network’ and ‘audience,’ each of which will be covered in two phases. First, students will study and evaluate key social scientific ideas that explain the social dimensions of technological design through readings, class discussions, and written assignments. Second, they will use those concepts to make experimental interventions, for example through archival research or fieldwork, video and image-based documentation, and creative experiments with design, in an effort to “design for a better world.”</p></p><h2>02.148HT Geographies of Money and Finance</h2><p><p>Money flows like mercury. It has entered every sphere of the world economy, transforming human relations over time and space. From pension funds to cryptocurrencies, societies revolve around finance. This course is open to students who are interested in learning about financial topics from a social scientific perspective, and will be helpful for those keen in careers in finance. Understanding the multi-scalar manifestations of the geographies of money and finance, and their influence in shaping relations (political, economic and social) are essential to designing better financial systems and applications.</p></p><h2>02.151HT Digital Worlds, Space and Spatialities: Geographical Perspectives on Digitalisation</h2><p><p>Contemporary life is increasingly being digitalized. The global information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure forms the network of Information flows that underpin the knowledge economy. Our experiences in the real world are complemented (or even replaced) by those in the virtual world. The explosion of informational and social media tools has shaped relational geography by changing how trust and authority are constructed in online spaces. Big Data analytics often include locational data that are used by both companies and governments, raising issues of surveillance, privacy and data monetization.</p></p><h2>02.152TS Urban Theory</h2><p><p>What is <em>the</em> city? This course aims to introduce and examine different theories of contemporary urbanization. Using a tripartite framework, this course engages the theoretical <em>groundings, perspectives</em>, and <em>visions of the city</em>. And according to Robert Beauregard, the city is characterized by the following four contradictions, namely, (i) a place of simultaneous wealth and poverty; (ii) a habitat that presumed environmental destructiveness yet saddled with the promise of sustainability; (iii) a polis of democracy but laced with the potential for oppressive surveillance; (iv) a public sphere where tolerance is encourage amid the marginalization of various groups. These central contradictions suggest that the city is an unfinished design project—replete with new opportunities and potentials awaiting rectifications and improvements by designers: architects, engineers, planners and policy-makers.</p></p><h2>02.153TS A History of Nuclear Strategy, Design, Technology and Society</h2><p><p>Since 1945, the world has been living under the shadow of the atomic bomb. Although atomic fission was discovered in 1938, and several nations had undertaken efforts to produce an atomic bomb during World War II, it was only with the destruction of Hiroshima that nuclear weapons burst, fully formed, onto the world stage. Introduced in combat at a time when the world system was being reshaped, nuclear weapons and nuclear power have occupied a privileged place in modern history and culture. This elective explores episodes in nuclear world history, including the international development of nuclear weapons, the arms race, fallout, and nuclear culture.</p></p><h2>02.156DH Games of Histories</h2><p><p>History often serves as the dramatic backdrop for many popular computer games we play today. Yet such historical representations are often riddled with misrepresentations and inaccuracies. This course aims at enabling students to acquire the historical knowledge necessary to build a credible and coherent history based story for video‐games through the lenses of some significant periods in European history such as the history of the rise and fall of the Roman Empire until Charlemagne and notable historical figures including Julius Caesar, Constantine the Great, Attila and Theoderic. To do so, the course will focus on some already existing and very successful video‐games, namely the three versions of the Total War video‐game: “Rome: Total War” (2004), “Rome: Total War” (2005), “Attila: Total War” (2015). Through a better understanding of history, students will acquire a firmer grasp of the value of historical knowledge and its rich potential for storytelling and the creation of compelling virtual worlds and online experiences.</p></p><h2>02.158DH Kings, monks, and merchants: A history of Asia before 1750</h2><p><p>This course is a connected and comparative history of Asia before 1750 that introduces students to the region’s major political, economic, and intellectual contours prior to British colonisation.</p></p><h2>02.159HT Equitable Tech: Reimagining Our Digital Infrastructures</h2><p><p>The course invites students to investigate how geopolitical conditions shape our differing relations to the Internet and its promises of the wireless, borderless world. Starting with the Internet scavenger hunt in their local communities, students will explore how the Internet is not an entirely virtual space floating in the ether but is where idiosyncratic technologies converge, reflecting their various material, institutional, and historical conditions.</p></p><h2>02.163 International Trade: Free Trade, Governance and Technology</h2><p><p>Trade is an essential human activity that dates back to the early days of civilization. In this globalized era, the production of goods and services has become much more internationalized, with countries specializing in the production of certain goods and services. With greater liberalization of trade, people can enjoy a greater variety of goods and services that arise from trade. As political and economic relationships are shaped by trade flows among countries, it has become ever more important to learn about trade as a highly internationalized, technologized and networked activity.</p></p><h2>02.164DH Performance: Design, Dramaturgy, and Interpretation</h2><p><p>This introductory course explores the ways we make meaning in theatre, performance and everyday life, including the domains of technology and design. We will consider closely how ‘sign-systems’ – spatial design, lighting, sound, multimedia, movement, objects and other production elements – guide the process of meaning-making and shape any performance’s dramaturgy. Importantly, this process is also embodied. This course ultimately brings semiotic methods of analysis (interpreting signs and symbols) into dialogue with phenomenological perspectives (being aware of embodied experience). These tools and skills enable one to understand how meaning is <em>created</em>, <em>communicated</em>, and <em>felt</em> in both art and life. We will explore how they can be used in myriad design and technology contexts within and outside of the theatre: engineering user interfaces, human-machine interactions, gaming dramaturgies, robotics, AR/VR experiences, and more.</p></p><h2>02.165TS Empathy: An interdisciplinary concept (Special Topics)</h2><p><p>Empathy is a valued trait in professional and social life, and is fundamental to healthy interpersonal relationships in both professional and social contexts. Learning about empathy is advantageous for students of design and engineering in promoting more effective interpersonal communication through cognitive and affective perspective taking, as well as a deeper consideration of end user needs and challenges.</p></p><h2>02.166TS Urban Southeast Asia: Diversity, Sustainability and Change</h2><p><p>Southeast Asia is a region of extraordinary natural, cultural, economic, and socio-political diversity. It is characterised by both patterns of continuity across time and space, as well as far-reaching and rapid social and physical development. These changes often centre around the region’s vibrant urban areas. This course surveys a variety of contemporary trends and challenges found across Southeast Asian cities surrounding the intersecting themes of diversity, sustainability, and change. We will explore what exactly makes this region – our region – so unique: its historical context, geopolitics, cultural and technological innovations, heritage practices, and urban design. At the same time, we will investigate how these factors impact Southeast Asia’s sustainable development goals, and therefore how we might imagine the role Southeast Asia could play in the future of our world. This is a survey course, and while you will be exposed to a wide range of issues relevant to contemporary Southeast Asia, you will also be encouraged to delve deeper into one or two select topics that are of particular interest to you.</p></p><h2>02.167HT Fashion: East and West (Special Topics)</h2><p><p>This course introduces a revisionist fashion history that de-centres the West (Europe and North America) and places the East as its equal counterpart. Sartorial cultures in Asia are studied in their own right and on their own terms. Students will explore the history of global cultural exchange through the lens of fashion, understand the differences and similarities between Eastern and Western sartorial cultures, and gain critical insights into contemporary fashion consumption and industry. The course follows a chronological and thematic approach that examines fashion’s intersections with other domains of social life such as class, identity, power, and politics. In particular, students will be introduced to the most pressing issues and debates animating today’s fashion world, i.e., cultural appropriation, sustainability, and its future on Web3. The course’ emphasis on the socio-cultural aspects of fashion’s multi-faceted problems in different parts of the value chain is critical to devising creative solutions that often require cross-disciplinary collaborations.</p></p><h2>02.170HT History of Surveillance in Modern Asia</h2><p><p>Surveillance is a key component of state governance and a recurring theme in modern history of Asia. This course examines how states have attempted to apply and develop surveillance technologies with ever greater accuracy, scale, and speed (as well as when and how they did not). Geographically, this course covers from South Asia to East Asia. It focuses on how colonial, national, and postcolonial governments have tried to control their subjects and foreigners within their territory, as well as how people have responded to these state initiatives. After introducing relevant theoretical frameworks, the course will delve into specific technologies such as fingerprints, photographs, anthropometrics, and CCTV, examining their historical development and impact on individual lives in modern Asian societies.  Through this course, students will examine people’s responses to surveillance technologies in modern Asia, ranging from adherence to protest. They will be able to appraise the use of surveillance in today’s Asian societies based on its historical trajectories.</p></p><h2>02.171 Religion and Society in Southeast Asia (Special Topics)</h2><p><p>Southeast Asia is located at the historical crossroads of world religious traditions, where religions play a more prominent role in the society as compared to most other parts of the world. This introductory course exposes students to the diverse and vibrant religious traditions of Southeast Asia. It is also an avenue to explore the past and present of Southeast Asian societies. Through the lens of social science theories, students will learn about the religions of Southeast Asia through the themes of ritual, festival, material culture, gender, and networks. We will also examine how and why religious traditions influence the everyday life in the region.</p></p><h2>02.172DH Imagine Dragons: Monsters and Outcasts in Literature, from Beowulf to Murakami</h2><p><p>Why do we find “monster” characters so fascinating? How do such figures blur the boundaries between human and non-human; citizen and outcast; familiar and unfamiliar; hero and outsider? Why is difference unsettling yet alluring? How do advancements in technology––from Frankenstein’s feats of engineering, to uses of weapon technologies in <em>Beowulf</em>, to mediums of travel in Chaucer, Lovecraft, and Carroll (travelling through space, time, and dreams)––facilitate new kinds of creation, new kinds of otherness, and new kinds of community? This course examines literary entities who are at odds with community, or who reside outside of community altogether. The readings and viewing assignments cover a range of genres, contexts, and mediums; they include classic works of literature as well as more recent ones, and film, dance, and music in addition to written texts. We will explore how isolated existences can be both blessing and bane; how concepts of belonging (and not belonging) figure into societies that are structured around race, gender, sexuality, custom, ideology, and religious belief; and how anxieties about monsters often, in fact, conceal underlying anxieties about what it means to be human.</p></p><h2>02.173DH The Medium and the Message: An Introduction to Media Theory</h2><p><p>In the digital age, the term “media” has become all but synonymous with forms of mass communication like social media and the news media. But, as the field of media theory explores, media forms have always encompassed far more than these. Since the dawn of <em>homo sapiens</em>, media of all different kinds––tools, elements, inventions, bodies, voices, technologies, creations––have shaped how human beings live; understand themselves; relate to one another; interface with the world around them; and formulate identities, whether personal, racial, religious, gendered, political, or national. Throughout the epochs, media have dreamed of (and sometimes succeeded in) conquering the bounds of space and time. In this course, we will traverse diverse landscapes of media objects, technologies, and infrastructures to consider fundamental questions about the human condition. How do the things we use to preserve, express, enhance, and define ourselves end up influencing the ways we think and behave, at both personal and societal levels? How do the designs of media objects and technologies actively shape their functions? The readings for each week comprise short literary texts, mostly stories or poems, that develop insight into the week’s intellectual concepts. These will be paired with excerpts from media theorists exploring key conceptual ideas and/or media models. </p></p><h2>02.174TS The Design of Digital Platforms</h2><p>Grasp the distinctive features that differentiate digital multi-sided platforms from conventional businesses.

Ryutaro Uchiyama
Collective systems function as more than the sum of their parts. From the origins of multicellular life to population coding in the brain, to human institutions like stock markets and shared narratives, we see the emergence of functional synergies across multiple scales or organization. While the psychological and behavioral sciences have traditionally focused on the individual, the unique achievements of humans among the animal kingdom derive primarily from our remarkable social organization. Converging evidence suggests that human individual intelligence is a byproduct of our collective intelligence rather than vice versa, highlighting a qualitative gap between the foundations of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. In this course, we will adopt multiple analytical lenses – psychological, biological, computational, and cultural – to understand emergent collective behavior. Along the way we will traverse such topics as social networks, self-organizing systems, economic games, animal sociality, human evolution, gene-culture co-evolution, global psychological variation, linguistic communication, and computational social cognition.

Work organizations are complex social systems that students will experience during internships and after graduation. This course is designed to build an understanding of how organizations behave and change by analyzing the workplace through different perspectives (or lenses).

The ability to act with skill and creativity in organizations begins with the development of multiple perspectives on organizations. Humans habitually settle into fixed perspectives, unchallenged mental models of how the world works, unconscious filters determining what we pay attention to and what we ignore. These habits offer powerful economies of thought: without them, the simplest task of picking a face out in a crowd or listening to the radio while driving would be impossible. But they impose ‘costs’ as well. They lock us into a single view of the world that may not be best, that is surely incomplete, resistant to change, and will become outdated. Overcoming organizational challenges requires the discipline of interpreting what we see and hear in organizations from multiple standpoints.

As a starting point, this course is organized around three different perspectives on organizations: thestrategic designperspective, theculturalperspective, and thepoliticalperspective. Each of them offers a different angle on what is an organization, and each offers different ‘tools for action’. People naturally populate these organizations. Accordingly, we will probe some of the psychological and social processes that are at work in organizations. We will then turn to a more in-depth treatment of the strategic design, political, and cultural perspectives on organization, and examine the implications of these insights for understanding the prospects and challenges of working in organizations.

We will begin the semester with discussions about psychology, bilingualism, and research, including introduction to various research methodology and technologies used in psychological and bilingualism research; we will then continue to have a more hands-on experience in designing and conducting a research project relating to topics in bilingualism. The course will culminate into an actual research project. Topics include representation and processing of languages in bilinguals, language acquisition and related cognitive development in bilingual children, bilingual brain, research designs of observational and experimental studies, statistical concepts used in research analyses, and technologies in bilingualism research. As part of the course, there will be multi-institution conference calls with MIT, Cornell University and Rutgers University, where they are running a similar course in the Spring semester, during which SUTD students will share their research ideas/projects with students from the other institutions, and vice versa, and may choose to follow up with each other after the calls. This will encourage interactions and exchanges of knowledge between students, researchers, and professors amongst the four institutions regarding bilingualism and bilingual research.

Studies the subjective side of technology and the social and psychological dimensions of technological change. Students write about specific objects and their role in their lives – memoir fragments – as a means of exploring theories of how scientific careers are born. How do a range of theories of child development help us understand the development of creativity in science and technology? How do scientific memoirs differ from those written by members of other fields? What is the range of memoir genres in science? Explores the connection between material culture, identity, cognitive and emotional development.

Understand how markets reach equilibrium between supply and demand.
Acquire basic notions of industrial organizations, game theory, bargaining and auction theory, and apply them to understand various social phenomena.
Learn to analyse the effects of shifting demand, supply, and conditions of competition, governmental policy and market structure on the economy.
Students will be assessed through exams and homework.
Students will need to be able to answer basic questions on microeconomics.
Students will need to be able to construct basic economic models and apply them to new situations.
Students will be asked to apply consumer theory to a variety of new situations.
The strategy of microeconomics for understanding economic behaviour is to start with individual economic agents – consumers and firms – and move ‘from the bottom up’ towards understanding market demand and supply. Following this route, we will learn how to analyse the market in equilibrium, and the advantages and disadvantages of various market structures (e.g., perfect competition or monopoly). While the basic story of microeconomics is a cheerful one for the competitive market, we will also study circumstances under which the market runs into difficulties for delivering efficient outcomes.

How do we attain status and success in society? One of the important premises in studies on status attainment is as follows: “It is not what you know but who you know.” This course focuses on how individuals and institutions build their social networks (connections) and social capital (trust, social influence, status, and resources). The course offers a critical understanding of social networks and social capital as essential factors in determining success and failure of individual and institutional undertakings. The course particularly considers the effects of social networks and social capital formation on education, finding jobs, forming ties, and building teams. This course is designed to balance theories, methods, and applications, drawing from the literature on sociology of social networks and social capital suitable for undergraduates and graduates.

Evaluate the arguments for and against mainstream management theory and practice
Develop an informed opinion on contemporary management issues through independent inquiry
Produce and submit on time, a written document that assesses a past or prevailing management fad/fashion or practice.
Construct and defend a short, critical review of a topic within mainstream management theory by delivering an oral presentation and/or a written presentation that captures the selected texts and theories succinctly.
Analyze and appraise mainstream theories by applying them to contemporary management issues (e.g. case studies)
This course was formerly titled ‘Critical management studies’. On the one hand, the name has been changed to reflect a shift in focus lay a foundation of core skills required for your professional life. On the other hand, the course will retain its critical perspective on management theory and practice. In other words, the word ‘critical’ in the title is two-fold: critical in the sense of something important or significant and critical in the sense of having a healthy skepticism towards the messages promoted by organizations regarding workplace behavior.

In this course, students will focus on three skills: critical thinking, communication and adaptability. Topics such as job performance, workplace communication and structures will be discussed and debated, culminating in a workplace simulation where the skills learned will be put into practice.

The course will be conducted in ‘seminar style’ which means that the 3 hours in class is built around discussion (peer to peer learning) and students are expected to read and complete given assignments before class. Class participation and engagement will be high as communication is a key skill to develop. Students are also expected to have acquired basic academic skills such as referencing and essay writing before enrolling in this course.

Please note that there is one final deadline for all out-of-class assignments (e.g. case studies, online assignments). Students are expected to manage their own time and submissions (i.e. you can submit assignments early) as it is impractical to try to accommodate the multiple deadlines, tests and exams of the various pillars, with this course. Late submissions will be subject to grade penalties.

Human life and technology are intertwined. It is difficult for an average person to imagine going through one day without using any technology. However, human beings are efficient but imperfect information processors and decision makers. Because of this, human behavior and decision are often marked by systematic departure from logical, rational ‘norms’. This course examines how technology and design interacts with, and changes, human behavior, and how human behavior redefines the status quo of technology and design. For example, the influence of technology use on memory, emotion, and well-being will be examined. The influence of human cognitive capacity on technology design also will be included in the course.

Another goal is to gain a greater sense of the diversity of human social practices and beliefs around the world.
A third goal is students will develop the ability to craft a persuasive argument backed by appropriate evidence, both orally and in writing.
Attendance and Oral Participation.Students must attend class and participate in discussions. Each class is keyed to a set of readings, and it is crucial that students keep up with the readings and be prepared to discuss them in class. All assignments require students to cite relevant readings.
Oral Reader Responses.These consist of a couple paragraphs describing your reaction to one or more of the readings for a given session. Do not summarize the reading, but rather give your response to the reading. Your group will present two responses over the course of the term.
Reflection Paper.Pick any one of the assigned reading and write an analysis of the reading. Provide an introduction of the topic, critique the methodology, findings and discussion and provide further research suggestions.
Group Presentation and Report.In groups, students will research any topic covered in the syllabus and present that topic to the class. This project may be completed in a variety of ways, through such means as (but not limited to) videos, panels, or talk show formats and presentations should be no more than 15 minutes long. In addition to the presentation, your group will submit a written report that outlines the following: the presentation topic, methodology, theories and concepts covered, lessons learnt (sociological takeaways from the project) and references.
Final Essay.Due in week 13, choose any one of the given topics and ensure you use at least 4 to 5 sociology sources from the syllabus and elsewhere to answer the question. You may also choose your own essay question (please seek prior approval from the instructor).
This course introduces students to the variety of ways in which people experience gender and sexuality and what it means to be a man or a woman in a range of social and cultural contexts examined through relevant concepts and theoretical constructs. We will explore how gender and sexuality are embedded in social institutions including the nation-state, identities, family, local and global work, relationships, technology, body image and consumption.

Classes will integrate lecture and discussion. Class participation — in terms of regular attendance and participation in discussion — will count strongly towards the final grade. Occasionally students will break into small groups for more concentrated discussion. Some lectures will directly engage the readings, while others will integrate background and theoretical information. The course and assignment have been designed to facilitate a bridge between theory and everyday life.

This course introduces students to the social scientific study of human-environment interactions through the history and culture of a single agricultural crop: rice. The cultivation of rice dates back almost 10,000 years in Asia, and forms the core of an independent origin of civilization, distinct from other Eurasian sites that were all based around wheat/barley and millet. Some scholars hypothesize that the cultivation of rice also supports a distinctive Asian form of society, and mode of historical or technological development, that differs from standard frameworks of ‘Western’ modernization. Today rice is one of the most intensively researched crops, as both a model organism for advanced research in genomics and an important object of genetic modification experiments. We will explore how the cultivation of rice raises exciting and provocative questions about the relationships among society, technology and environment. The course asks whether Asia’s history and culture of rice can provide an alternative figure of technological development and design, and perhaps a model for a sustainable relationship between humans and their natural environments.

When tsunamis flood cities, earthquakes turn highways to rubble, and epidemics of killer disease break out, we often blame Nature for bringing disaster onto vulnerable human populations.  To prevent future catastrophe, we place our faith in science and technology, hoping to better control Nature’s forces next time.  Yet the fault lines of disaster often fall along lines laid out by human activities and plans, including earlier projects of science and engineering.  Flooding in one part of New Orleans resulted from the construction of dykes in other parts, for instance; and the 3-11 tsunami’s most terrible outcome was due to the design and location of the Fukushima nuclear plant.

In this course, we explore these human, social and cultural dimensions of natural and technological disasters.  The course begins by exploring how the idea of a ‘natural’ disaster, devoid of divine intervention or religious meaning, first emerged.  Through a series of cases from around the world, the course then explores why contemporary disasters can be considered “unnatural:” how do disasters expose and exacerbate the contours of social inequality?  How has human technological intervention increased vulnerability to disaster?  How are science, technology, economy and politics implicated in disaster response?  And how can the variations of culture, belief and cosmology be included in our understanding of disasters?

In their assignments, students will conduct ‘social autopsies’ of disasters, and will appraise how technological design and engineering can both mitigate and enhance the risk and vulnerability to disaster.

Instructor</p><h2>02.226 Leaders & Followers</h2><p><p>This course is part of a suite of three electives in management studies taught by Dr Grace Dixon (the other two being <a href="https://hass.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-subjects/elective/02-202-organizational-processes"><em>Organizational Process</em></a> and <a href="https://hass.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-subjects/elective/02-211-critical-management-studies"><em>Critical Management Skills</em></a>). Students who have completed these courses recommend starting with <em>Organizational Process</em> before considering <em>Leaders and Followers</em>. It can, nevertheless, be taken as a standalone module.</p></p><h2>02.228TS Design in the Anthropocene</h2><p><p>The ‘Anthropocene’ refers to ‘(the) Age of Mankind’—the subsequent geological age after the Holocene that denotes the significant and unprecedented impacts of human actions on different global systems. The world in the Anthropocene is quintessentially, a ‘world as design’. Yet design studies have yet to be connected to, or contextualized within, the novel conditions that accompany the onset of the Anthropocene, when artificial design has unprecedentedly become the background, as well as the approach, for coordinating and supporting everyday life. What are the new categories for design in the Anthropocene? Furthermore, how do these categories and concepts modify, or even confound, what we already understand in design theory? What then are the new issues and challenges for design in the Anthropocene? In this course, existing design theory will be introduced, and explicated in relation to the Anthropocene condition through seven emerging topical issues: (i) designing with living systems 1 (human-beings); (ii) designing with living systems 2 (more-than-human agencies and other ecosystems); (iii) open systems and incomplete design; (iv) large-scale sociotechnical systems 1: Smart Cities; (v) large-scale sociotechnical systems 2: Artificial Intelligence; (vi) large-scale sociotechnical systems 3: Climate change adaptations; (vii) design ethics.</p></p><h2>02.230TS Health Communication and Behavior Change</h2><p><p>There is an increasing recognition of the role social and technological factors play in shaping the health and well-being of individuals. Communication, from the personal to mass and social media, have been demonstrated to have both beneficial and harmful effects on health and well-being. This course provides an introduction to the theory and practice of health communication and behavior change. It will cover the definition and history of health communication, the role of media and technology, social scientific theories used in health communication and behavior change, as well as how these theories can be applied to the real-world. The course will aim to bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world examples, and is suitable for students with varying interests, especially those who are interested in harnessing communication, design, and technology for better health and well-being in society.</p></p><h2>02.231TS Transportation Technology and Policy in Urban Progress</h2><p><p>This course introduces a conceptual framework for understanding real-world topics related to transportation technology and urban policy applications by examining a variety of international cases and development practices, including Singapore and other emerging economies in Asia, in a comparative manner. Particularly, the course tries to inspect and explain the dynamic and complex interplays between (i) evolving transportation technology, (ii) entrepreneurial state policy, and (iii) urban market progress/shrinkage on different network levels and/or geographic scales – macro, mezzo, and micro – in contemporary development and even prospect management contexts. Therefore, the “technologies” covered by this course are not only typical urban travel modes within cities (e.g., private automobile, public transit, and non-motorized transportation) but also extensive and unconventional interregional passenger, freight, and communication systems across cities (e.g., aviation, high-speed rail, worldwide e-commerce and e-logistics, and emerging smart applications). The urban influences of various transportation technologies in globalization as well as localization are widely reviewed from engineering, financial, economic, environmental, and social standpoints, and technological potentials and policy challenges are proactively discussed for upcoming applications in Asia’s urban development and management contexts.</p></p><h2>03.007 Design Thinking and Innovation</h2><p>Identify concepts, themes and skills related to design

Uncertainty appears everywhere in life, arising naturally in science, engineering, design, and humanities. Probability and statistics are two powerful and complementary ways to explain, forecast, and visualise uncertainty. Probability uses knowledge of a system’s behaviour to predict its future outcomes, while statistics analyses data from past outcomes to model a system’s behaviour. Probability and statistics are applied in virtually all industries that govern modern society; they are particularly important in disciplines including ﴾but not limited to﴿ finance, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning. In this course, we will introduce the fundamentals of probability and statistics through real life problems and software. Students will complete projects related to applications such as climate adaptation, pharmaceutical testing, vaccine distribution, and product safety assurance.

Weekly Topics</p><h2>10.024 Spatial Design World</h2><p>Spatial Design World integrates 3D scanning, parametric modelling, AI-driven design exploration, and digital fabrication in a hands-on curriculum that strengthens students’ abilities in both 2D and 3D representation. Emphasis is placed on developing high-quality drawing skills and workflows that leverage advanced software tools. By weaving together orthographic drawings, axonometric illustrations, and emerging AI solutions, students learn to document, analyse, and transform physical spaces with precision and creativity.

Participants tackle progressively complex tasks, from conceptual planning to prototyping, while refining presentations through data-driven simulations and digital fabrication techniques such as 3D printing. They orchestrate efficient workflows that blend analog and digital methods, gaining technical fluency and a deep understanding of foundational design principles like scale, proportion, and spatial hierarchy. These experiences encourage holistic problem-solving, helping students confidently integrate state-of-the-art technologies into their spatial design processes.</p><h2>20.099 Urban Sketching</h2><p>Sketching is a way of communication and expression. Sketching architecture is a way to understand and record our spatial environment. Urban Sketching is designed to equip students with fundamental sketching skills with a focus on the urban fabrics and landscapes.</p><h2>20.101 Architecture Core Studio 1</h2><p>Carlos Bañón
The studio establishes foundations for architectural design through three projects that build in scope and complexity to have students engage issues of 3-dimensional geometry and drawing, space and component aggregation, ordering systems, structure, circulation and narrative, and tectonics. The design process is introduced as an iterative form of research, experimentation, and play, enabling students to develop conceptual ideas about architecture and translate them into a series of physical and material investigations. Each exercise is envisioned as an introduction to design thinking through an increasingly more complex set of relationships with regard to formal procedures, programs, and systems.

Students are required to work in both physical and digital models, and rehearse both analogue and digital drawing techniques for each exercise. The exercises will test both conceptual and analytical thinking as well as aid in the development of representational skills.

Architecture Core Studio 3 expands the complexity of architectural design challenges further to the issue of human habitation. Seeking sustainable approaches to high-density living students will investigate the essential physical and social requirements for human dwelling and the mutual potentials evolving between the urban condition and innovative forms of residence.

Applying integrative design strategies building structures will be developed as coherent synthesis of load-bearing systems and of concepts for spatial hierarchies that anticipate issues like program, circulation and relation to the territory. With the provision of human comfort being a primary concern of habitation the design studio will also focus on the envelope’s capacities to control and facilitate exposure to climate, on its materiality and composition. In coordination with other courses students will expand design strategies to an integrative and simultaneous development of architectural form and building systems and develop an understanding of the relevance of building performance parameters.

Daniel Joseph Whittaker
The development of a building design to its actual construction is not a predetermined process. Each architectural design is an autonomous and unique scenario demanding a high level of creative invention supported by current and responsible technological knowledge. This understanding of the technology of assemblies should be less a mere familiarity with devices and products but rather, a working understanding of the forces, both general and specific, that affect the performance of building systems and the architecture. With this understanding, architects and engineers can then design physical assemblies and systems that both respond to and collaborate with these forces. The eventual humanity and beauty of any architectural construct is an almost pure reflection of the depth of both the thought of and individual, and the highly complex interactions of a collective effort. This course intends for the full depth of design possibilities to unfold and be revealed, not constrained, as technological issues are introduced. The building technology sequence in the core curriculum terms begins with an introduction to the performance requirements, physics and physical phenomena and construction systems of contemporary buildings. The intention of this class will be to link the diversity of physical forces relevant to building performance to the materials, components, assemblies and large scale systems that control and direct these forces and guide performance. This introduction will be phased to deliver to the entering Architecture and Sustainable Design student key concepts and essential analytical skills necessary for the rigorous selection and design of structural systems, enclosure and façade systems, environmental and energy systems, and circulation and interior systems. The scope of the class includes these major systems to an intermediate level of understanding and an introductory level of analysis and system design. Subsequent classes in the building technologies will build on all four systems in both detail complexity and integrative depth.

This class is an introduction to the science and physics of building design and performance and an understanding of contemporary building construction methods, materials, and technical information necessary for a responsible making of a humane built environment. It is also intended as an introduction to the historical foundations and cultural contexts in which construction technologies have been developed over time. The focus of the class will be put on an understanding of tectonic principles: the materials and components that comprise buildings, their relationship to the manufacturing processes, and the forces and physical phenomenon of performance requirements. Beyond that there will also be a substantial discussion of the environmental consequences of the construction and operation of the built environment. While the scope of the course is broad, it is not, and could never be, a comprehensive treatment of all issues regarding the design and construction of buildings. However, the course will address all of the primary forces that determine the configuration, materials and processes of construction and the integration of building systems into the completed whole.
The learning objectives listed below constitute the essential elements of a holistic understanding of the various ways in which contemporary building systems deliver services to occupants in a reliable, safe and efficient manner. The main learning objective will be the acquisition of an analytical understanding of the performance of building systems and a qualitative appreciation of the system dynamics of these systems within the larger construction and with regard to all other building systems.

Students will be able to:

The key outcome will be for the student to be able to articulately describe the performance of a building system, its function, its intended operational goals and its essential working elements. Also, the student will be able to measure the predicted performance of a system.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides rich, machine-readable representations of proposed building designs. With BIM, it becomes practical to embed into computational tools the accumulated knowledge regarding good design and construction practices. This subject is designed to provide students with fundamental knowledge and basic practical skills of the planning and execution of Building Information Models. It is also aimed to offer opportunities for students to establish a basic understanding of those elements that impact the generation of a Building Information Model, including methods of communication, data creation, social, and economic factors between trades. Building models will be challenged with analysis software to test for various performance criteria. Learning occurs through design cases of building over 4 stories and wide span structures as a way to learn behaviours of all building systems. Students will also use visual programming skills to design parametric schematics.

Far from isolated trajectories, new ideas, scientific discoveries, technology innovation, and aesthetic avant-gardes occur in a highly interconnected manner. Complex dynamics between architectural designs and their cultural and technological contexts attest that architecture is not fully autonomous as it serves, negates, distorts, questions and produces its context. The course analyses the development of contemporary architecture through its relationships with technological and scientific advances. The course is roughly organized in a chronological format, starting with a brief overview of the industrial revolution and the early 20th century, placing emphasis on the second half of the 20th century and the development of current digital culture in architecture.

Students develop an understanding of the relationships between architectural design, technology innovation and scientific ideas that led to contemporary architectural practice and theory. In this course, architectural design is placed into a broader intellectual context, which helps students not only understand the “what and how” architects do but also build perspective and framework to reflect on the “whys”.

Immanuel Koh
Today, we are all, voluntarily or involuntarily, surrounded by objects and built environments driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI). This phenomenon has not only led to the automation of designs themselves, but more fundamentally, the automation of design cognition and the optimization of aesthetic imaginations for our cultural futures. If architects and designers are to continue in playing their roles as cultural producers, social activists and technological imaginaries, a holistic understanding of today’s AI systems is essential. Such a foundational knowledge will provide the much-needed historical and theoretical bases for critically reassessing the current nature of design processes and reframing the future culture of architecture and design. The course will begin by tracing the fascinating and intertwined genealogies of artificial intelligence and architectural intelligence from the 1960s onwards. This history will be vividly brought forth to the present with complementary readings on AI aesthetics, AI artists and other emerging AI design topics, such as adversarial-based design algorithms, post-truth redesign of visual culture, unsolicited algorithmic cultivation of collective design tastes, and the territorial politics of computer vision-based surveillances. Beyond the ‘critical writing’ of AI & Design, students will also work in groups to speculate ‘critical designs’ based on their newly acquired perspectives on the culture and nature of artificial designs. The deliverables are in the forms of design mock-ups, visual diagrams and written texts.

The ‘Urban Housing Typology’ seminar will discuss the complex nature of urban contexts as places to formulate human habitation. Investigating the interdependencies evolving between a building’s entity and its urban territory students will speculate how strategies for urban building types have contributed in the past and can contribute in the future to urban development.

Participants will understand the relevance of housing typology research and the potentials of designer’s repositories of known housing precedents as design expertise. Having gained a clear understanding of concepts like ‘type’ and ‘typology’ students will analyse both contemporary and historical housing precedents of building types like Block Enclosure, Urban Infill, Solitaire, Superblock, Apartment Tower, Residential Estate and Urban Row Houses. With these building types as typically evolving within and due to specific contextual conditions the investigations will make essential connections to a building’s territory, its urban type, its historical and economical context, its density and programs.

Beyond discussing precedents as a typological knowledge on merely immutable built physical forms the course will also investigate the potential of operational building strategies like incrementalism, usage flexibility and neutrality, and user participation for sustainable urban communities. Both autochthonous building types and contemporary precedents with a particular focus on sustainable building performance will be another focus.

Zheng Kai
The course is intended to give students enrolled a working understanding of how to design, construct, and operate sustainable architecture and urban design developments and projects toward achieving carbon neutral on all aspects. Students will develop an understanding of a building’s relationship to its site’s natural systems; the building enclosure’s ability to mitigate outdoor conditions; passive systems for conditioning and lighting; mechanical heating, cooling and ventilation strategies; lighting and daylighting opportunities; site and building water cycles; and health and well-being, and advanced building and environmental system simulation through a series of lectures and workshops.

Case studies will be introduced based on the lecture themes. Topics are discussed based on the physical laws that govern the exchange of energy between building and environment and how they relate to human comfort. The ability and confidence in making both quantitative and qualitative statements about building performance will help students in integrating these considerations into their future architecture and urban design work. Ultimately students will be able to understand the impact of their design decisions on building performance in order to mitigate the carbon footprint.

Workshops throughout the semester will be a series of design exercise and environmental design studies as well as calculations, which will serve as supporting documents for the final carbon-neutral project at the end of the semester.

The course is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between Architecture and Sustainable Design and Engineering Product Development. It brings together material science and digital fabrication, fusing natural composites with industrial robotics, aiming to produce innovation in the realm of sustainable design and manufacturing. It suggests that designs inspired by biological processes found in nature, may assist in transforming society toward a more environmentally benign mode of production from the ground up. This process starts from the understanding of the principles behind structural biological systems and the development of tools embracing the paradigm imposed by nature instead of those predefined by the existing manufacturing technologies. As a research and design course, students are required to develop their own proposals, methods and artefact which may lead to publication of results in journals and conferences.

Jason Lim
Augmented Reality has crossed a significant threshold in its development with the recent introduction of hardware and programming kits such as the HoloLens and ARCore / ARKit respectively. It is now more accessible to end-users who may wish to adopt this technology for their specific domain purposes. The moment is ripe for architects, who comprise one such group of end-users, to explore the potentials of AR and critically evaluate where it can be used to enhance established workflows.

If AR does indeed have the potential to disrupt how architecture is currently conceived, represented and materialized, then it would be critical to expose students to such technology. This elective course will furnish students with conceptual and technical knowledge, enabling them to explore how AR can be utilized at various stages of the design to production process. Furthermore, it will build upon topics introduced earlier in the core syllabus relating to computation and fabrication.

The objective of this course is to ensure students become adroit users of AR, as well as to contribute and possibly shape the nascent discourse around this technology in the architectural domain.

Immanuel Koh
The course provides an overview of today’s machine learning apparatus for generative design and in turn speculates on the ways in which architectural design process itself might be altered as a result of this epistemological shift towards a ‘Software 2.0’ paradigm. By situating the discourse within an experimental prototyping context, students will not only gain the practical experience of applied machine learning workflow, but more importantly the architectural sensibility to conceptualize, articulate and implement their design applications in relation to these state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. Students are expected to work in small groups, curating and preparing the dataset; selecting and training the machine learning model; and finally generating designs from the learnt data distribution. The deliverables are in the forms of a design prototype and a written report, which could be used for future exhibition and publications.

The course provides a cross-disciplinary overview of methods to assess and design Net Zero buildings, products, and systems in the context of global climate change. The course is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between Architecture and Sustainable Design and Engineering Product Development. The course investigates contemporary definitions of Net Zero Carbon and argues for the necessity of Whole Life Carbon assessment and design. An understanding of contemporary assessment methods is provided through study of the GHG Protocol, explicating the three scopes of carbon emissions, in concert with critically examined case studies of Net Zero buildings, products and systems.

The course prioritizes preventing carbon emissions before they take place as part of the whole life carbon position, through lectures on impact assessment, design/process optimization. Additionally, an overview of contemporary work on carbon cycle, carbon management, carbon offsets and credits including carbon capture and sequestration provides a fuller picture to students of how Net Zero carbon may be attained.

Students apply critical thinking and their disciplinary expertise to developing case study reports on a product, building or system of their choice and how it may be converted to Net Zero whole life carbon. Additional creative activities with lifecycle assessment, systems thinking, and games provide students with understanding and tools to supplement the case study with projections or scenarios. The final written report may be used for future sharing in educational context or in the context of conferences, publications.

[Latinrepraesentare‘to make present or manifest’] 1. Depicting or ‘making present’ something which is absent (e.g. people, places, events, or abstractions) in a different form: as in paintings, photographs, films, or language, rather than as areplica.

“the making present in some sense of something which is nevertheless not present literally or in fact.”Hanna Pitkin.The Concept of Representation.(University of California Press: Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1967)

“architects don’t build buildings, they make drawings”1,Evans, R. (1996) “Translations from Drawing to Building and Other Essays”. London: Architectural Association Publications

If drawings are our language as designers, we surely must then enrich our vocabulary and foster new modes of meaningful of expression to allow for the emergence of true poetry;
to communicateto provoketo seduceto speculate

« forms & types of representation »operates as a testing laboratory for exploring the processes and methods embedded within the creative act of projecting.

This course attempts to both, provide a historical/theoretical context to the importance of the act of re-presentation -external to architecture, within contemporary critical thought, and to introduce a set of techniques to reconnect to the creative act, both to exceed design and to reinvent it through the formation of new narratives.

The examination of contemporary methodologies of media research and practice will provide a context for the better understanding of the why/how/when in relationship to history, technology and the human condition.

Our objective is to generatecritical engagement with mediaby research -and application. We approach this through a two-fold strategy; on the one hand, a series of lectures and seminars, wherenewapproaches to media are presented and dissected with the students through in-class analysis and textual responses. On the other hand, during the second part of the course, the students will be introduced to a variety of representation techniques, triggering hands on, in-class work lasting one week. Such assignments aim at constructingTête-à-têtestrategies that apply theoretical and practical knowledge, weaving them and (re)conceptualising the relationship between media and design through personal projects.

The goal is to ultimately sharpen students’ intellectual agility and to foster the reinvention of methods and mechanisms through which new modes of practice -in design and architecture, could emerge.

This course uses Kolb’s experiential learning, which involves numerous active learning and 2D design activities. The 2D projects occur at two instances of the term, structured to apply concepts learnt in class to address interdisciplinary problems within the EPD Pillar specialisation tracks. This is a 12 unit subject, which means that the overall weekly time commitment is, on average, approximately 12 hours. Workload is composed of cohort based learning sessions (5.0 hr.), and individual self-study time (7 hr.) per week.  The cohort based learning will consists of mini-lectures and breakout group activities.










Projects:Grades for the projects will be assigned on a group basis, unless otherwise specified.  Peer evaluations of each project will be required.  These peer evaluations, in addition to evaluation by the instructors, are used to assess individual participation on the group projects and will influence each individual’s grade.  No late projects will be accepted.


All assignments must be turned in on time. Assignments will not be accepted/graded after the due date/time. Do not attempt to hand-in late assignments, unless you have prior approval of the faculty.  Verbatim copying of any material that you submit for credit is a serious academic offense and will result in penalties and perhaps failing the course.

Students develop a holistic view and competency in the combined interactions of engineering design and engineering project management. Working in small teams, students carry out a design project targeting practical and functional devices. Students learn design, analysis, prototyping, testing, and project management methods to eﬀectively plan, organize, and execute an engineering project. Emphasis is placed on creativity, innovation, and the use of engineering analysis to reduce errors and iterations in the design process.

This course builds on the design pedagogy of 3.007 and focuses on engineering intensive design, requiring analysis and modeling to complete the project. This course prepares for subsequent courses on technical engineering analysis subjects by providing motivational case studies and contextual examples of the engineering analysis materials. This course prepares for the capstone design course 1.401 by providing understanding of all necessary steps and project management communication documentation necessary to successfully execute the capstone design project, which will make use of additional engineering topics of the junior and senior year.

This course will provide you with the indispensable computational skills required by modern engineers. We will use statistical, numerical, and computational methods to efficiently design complex engineering systems. We will go on a journey beyond the simple “toy” models that can be handled analytically to solving systems that are similar to those seen in real-world industry.
The objective of this course is to provide students practical experience applying the major analytical techniques that are essential in modern engineering analysis. After completing the course, the students will be able to use computers to statistically design and optimise complex engineering systems and use numerical methods to model the performance of engineering and physical systems.

Besides developing fundamental modelling and statistical analysis skills, students will further develop their programming skills and working principles to a level that they can computationally design engineering systems.
Students will participate actively and will be encouraged to openly clarify problems during the class. Each topic will be delivered in a mini-lecture form with interactive quizzes incorporated into the mini lecture. Following the mini lectures, students will work on group-based case problems and individual computer programming exercises. Throughout the course students will gain hands-on experience solving engineering problems by writing programming code in Python. The final three weeks of the term will be dedicated to individual projects, which will provide each student with practical experience applying statistical and numerical modelling methods to real engineering systems.
The course will follow selected chapters from the following textbooks:

This course aims to extend the fundamental concepts of thermodynamics from that covered in Engineering in The Physical World to include phase-change processes, transient systems and the concept of useful work and irreversibility. This course also focuses on fundamental heat transfer processes such as steady state and transient conduction, forced and natural convection systems. These fundamental concepts are then applied to the design of processes and equipment.




The basic objective of 30.109 Thermal Systems for Power and Environment is to give a solid understanding of the science of energy and energy conversion processes. In detail, this includes properties of pure substances and phase-change processes; ideal and real gas behaviour; energy exchange in power processes; reversible and irreversible processes; application of the first and second laws to engineering systems; rates of energy transfer and heat exchange; steady and transient systems; quantification of irreversibility and connection to lost work. In addition, there is also an emphasis in introductory heat transfer concepts which includes steady-state conduction (Fourier’s law) and transient conduction (lumped system analysis and Heisler charts); empirical correlations in forced convection for internal and external flow; natural convection; fin equations (solutions and analysis); heat exchanger types and design.


A second objective is to guide you towards an understanding of the fundamental skills, knowledge, and sensitivities that are the traits of a successful engineer. These include the skills necessary to work successfully in a group (including technical and graphical communication) and those of self-education (reading, research, and experimentation). Professional engineers have the knowledge and confidence to make estimates of poorly known parameters, create conceptual models of systems, assess applicability of various models and their resulting solutions to encountered problems, and design new solutions to meet technical challenges.






Lessons will be conducted in an open environment in which lectures, practical, labs, demonstrations and problem solving will be naturally blended together. Students will learn by doing and discussing with each other and with the instructors.

In 30.111, students are expected to start up a new venture based on their design projects for experiential learning. In the past few years, Kickstarter campaigns have been used as the medium of the startup projects. Lectures, studio sessions, guest panel sharing sessions and readings aid experiential learning. 30.111 is supported by an “ecosystem” of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and designers.





The course is designed for those interested in a techno-entrepreneurship career, e.g., starting up their own tech business or working as a member of startups. Via this course, students are expected to develop their personalized understanding and approaches for entrepreneurship, and possibly an entrepreneurial career option upon graduation. Our eventual goal is to produce holistic entrepreneurs who are engineers.






Students are expected to start up a new venture based on their design projects for experiential learning. Experiential learning is based on the development, launching, maintenance and reflection of a crowdfunding campaign project. Experiential learning is aided by lectures, studio sessions, guest panel sharing sessions and readings on the social-technical factors and forces that affect the startup process, and the scientific principles underpinning the integrated product-process-people decisions under extreme uncertainty.

This project-based design course aims to teach the students in developing fundamentals of the design aspects of biomedical and healthcare devices and diagnostics. The course has been designed to educate students to solve real-life clinical problems using their engineering knowledge by designing and developing biomedical products that can be ranging from devices, in-vitro diagnostic kits, and instruments.

During the first week of class, students for project teams (~3-4 students per team) to carry out a design project to solve a clinical problem (identified and proposed by healthcare professionals). Case studies of biomedical device designs and hands-on prototyping sessions are used extensively throughout the course. These, as well as guest lectures (clinicians and MedTech start-up experts), discussion sections, and design reviews, are designed to encourage students to consider the broader social and clinical contexts of engineering and design. Emphasis will be on the development of creative and innovative designs that are motivated by qualitative and quantitative analytical models. There will also be lectures on specific aspects pertinent to medical devices including regulatory, safety, and testing requirements and design control guidance.

Design activities include: (i) understand and document the clinical challenge, needs, users, and environment (meet clinical mentor and observe the problem by yourself at the hospital), (ii) develop technical and functional requirements and design specifications, generate and select design concepts, and (iii) perform design calculations, optimize the design, and necessary design trade-offs, and (iv) experimental prototyping and requirements verification testing. This course will have a significant communication component as students will present ideas in class, to the medical community, and to designers and engineers at SUTD.

At the end of the course, students would have gained the knowledge needed to design and develop healthcare products, acquired an understanding of fundamental principles of design process and aspects of biomedical devices and diagnostics, and learned how to execute a successful healthcare product design and development by avoiding common quality and regulatory issues.






This project-based design course aims to teach the students in developing fundamentals of the design aspects of biomedical and healthcare devices and diagnostics. The course has been designed to educate students to solve real-life clinical problems using their engineering knowledge by designing and developing biomedical products that can be ranging from devices, in-vitro diagnostic kits, and instruments.


Students completing this course should be able to:





The course will include instructor-led lectures and discussions and in-class individual and group design-activities during a class session (1 x 2 hours/week). Cohort class sessions (1 x 3 hours/week) will be the time to review team tasks, assignments, and progress. Students complete most of their design work outside of class and cohort sessions. Each week of this course will include a variety of design activities: lectures on healthcare engineering topics, invited lectures by other professors and researchers working in the medical device field, hands-on prototyping, discussions, and presentations from your classmates. Weekly meetings for each group will be arranged with the course faculty to review the progress and brainstorm/solve project design problems as well as assist in locating appropriate resources required. Like other design courses at SUTD, starting from the first week, students are expected to maintain a lab notebook or design journal that will be updated to keep track of the design process throughout the course. Students are expected to deliver a functioning proof-of-concept prototype that solves an unmet clinical need. At the end of the term, each team will give a 30-minutes presentation and discussion to the class as well as other interested parties from Medical Community and SUTD.





Projects

1D: This is a project-based course. Please refer the grading section for assessment components.


Assignments

All individual assignments are to be performed separately. Group assignments are to be completed with input and agreement from all teammates; all members of the team will be expected to be able to explain the assumptions and reasoning behind the submitted work. Homework assignments are project tasks, completing the homework is mandatory toward completing the project. Homework assignments are also components of the design reviews (refer grading section).


Peer Evaluation

Peer evaluations of contributions to group work will be used individualize grades on the project. These points are to ensure that students take an active role in the learning process and are fully engaged in all aspects of the course. Each team member will assume a Team Leader position on a rotating basis, and will be in charge of a design review or the final presentation. The peer evaluation score will include an assessment of each member’s participation level, quality of work, and leadership skills.


Class Participation

This portion of final grades includes active participation during class discussions, in-class design activities, case-study discussions, and prototyping sessions. You are also expected to actively participate in providing feedback to other teams during their design review presentations.


Design Reviews

Two separate formal design reviews resulting in a group grade: 15-minutes presentations to the class with 15-minutes discussion for each group focusing on the assigned review criteria. Each presentation and associated report. Written reports parallel the presentations and follow the formatting as described.


Final Exam

Each group will give 20-minute presentations to CGH healthcare professionals and SUTD designers and engineers with 10 minutes Q&A. You will cover the design question, approach, and development of the Final Project. Term paper will be the final report. No separate report needed.


Technical Innovation

Final working prototypes from each group will be evaluated for innovative approach to solve the proposed problem and against the group’s updated needs statement and design requirements. Whether your final proposed solutions innovatively meet the design requirements?


To gain greater benefit from the in-class discussions and briefing, you should complete the assigned reading before coming to class. Even a superficial first reading the night before the class period will improve your comprehension and retention of the material covered and can actively participate in discussions. Your performance in this course will rely on how well you assimilate the assigned reading, apply for your team project, participate in in-class discussions, and design contributions. The project result (working proof-of-concept prototype) and all purchased materials must be turned in at the end of the course.

This subject introduces students to key micro-fabrication and nano-engineering techniques that serve as a “toolbox” for product design in the micro/nano-technology area. Concepts, ideas and enabling tools of micro/nano-technologies are taught through hands-on intensive lab modules, which include microfluidics, micro and nano-patterning, nanomaterials and molecular scale imaging tools. Students will learn to operate some common instruments in the area of micro/nano-technology (e.g. UV exposure, plasma treatment machine, upright and inverted fluorescence microscope, nanoimprinter, scanning electron microscope), make micro/nano-scale devices and structures, perform experimental observation and improve experimental set-ups. The course is highly interdisciplinary in the development of integrative thinking of fundamental science and engineering knowledge curriculum through building, observing and manipulating objects at the micro and nano-scale. Students will have a broad view on how micro/nano-technologies are being advanced, and their huge impact on biomedical and precise manufacturing applications.


This is an advanced undergraduate course that focuses on laboratory learning on the topic of micro-fabrication and nano-engineering techniques. This course provides hands-on experiences via building, observing and manipulating micro and nano-scale structures/devices.  This course also exposes students to the state-of-the-art micro/nano-technologies, and prepares them with hands-on skills to enter relevant industrial careers.


Students completing this course should be able to:





This course includes one instructor-led lecture (1.5 hr) and one laboratory session (3.5 hr) with the assistance from instructor and TA in each week. The alternating lecture and laboratory scheme allows to continually applying concepts introduced in lecture to the laboratory bench top. The lectures cover the background, fundamental principles, engineering problems and practical applications of key techniques at the micro and nano-scale. The lab modules will give students the opportunities to touch, see, design and build micro and nano-scale objects and think about their design implications and the underlying science through lab sessions. For each lab module, a comprehensive lab manual containing background material, laboratory protocols and lab write-up questions will be distributed in lecture. There are 10 lab modules organized into the following categories (subject to change):



In the laboratory, 3-4 students form a group to complete all the experiments together. The small group setting allows all the students to personally experience the technique and operate on advanced tools.  All the students are highly encouraged to maintain a separate lab notebook for recording any observations, results, or comments while performing the experiments. Students will also find it helpful to carry a USB drive to download data, or a camera to record images. To ensure that there are no injuries or accidents, lab safety training is mandatory. Lab attire includes close-toed shoes; no shorts or loose clothing/hair. Follow common sense in the lab, e.g. running and jumping around can be potentially dangerous!




Class attendance and participation in experiments are required, and will be reflected in the final grade. Communication with the instructors and staff helps us get to know you, and is a valuable skill for working through problems and maximizing your laboratory experience.

No required text. Lecture note will be posted in e-Dimension prior to the lecture. In order to gain greater benefit from the lectures, the students should go through the lecture notes prior to the class.

The course is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between Architecture and Sustainable Design and Engineering Product Development. It brings together material science and digital fabrication, fusing natural composites with industrial robotics, aiming to produce innovation in the realm of sustainable design and manufacturing. It suggests that designs inspired by biological processes found in nature, may assist in transforming society toward a more environmentally benign mode of production from the ground up. This process starts from the understanding of the principles behind structural biological systems and the development of tools embracing the paradigm imposed by nature instead of those predefined by the existing manufacturing technologies. As a research and design course, students are required to develop their own proposals, methods and artifact which may lead to publication of results in journals and conferences.



After successful completion of the subject students will be able to:





The class is conducted as project based module. The assignments build towards the final project. Students are expected to produce (a) a demonstration of the proof of concept of their process and products (parametric models, computer software, end-effectors, physical artifacts, visual documentation) and (b) a research publication-ready draft paper as their final report (max 3,000 words, 10-pages document, including figures and references).

Iterative methods are mathematical procedures that use an initial value to generate a sequence of improving approximate solutions for a class of problems, in which the current approximation is derived from the previous ones. This course introduces two important types of iterative methodologies often encountered in the analysis and design of engineering systems: 1) metaheuristic optimisation algorithms; and 2) model-based analysis and design tools for dynamical systems.

The first part of the course focuses on metaheuristics optimisation algorithms — artificial intelligence search methods used to find approximate solutions to complex optimisation problems (potentially) under incomplete information and/or limited computation power. The course will describe a variety of metaheuristic search methods including simulated annealing, tabu search, evolutionary algorithms, swarm optimisation, and multi-objective methods.

The second part of the course introduces basic models for dynamical systems (discrete-time state space representations), core system properties, and model-based design methods for estimation and control. State space models characterize the time evolution of dynamical systems, from particular initial conditions, in response to driving external inputs. In this part of the course, we will introduce important system-theoretic properties (equilibria, stability, observability, and controllability) that characterize the behaviour and evolution of system trajectories and enable analysis and design for estimation and control.

Xu Ying
Successful orchestration of planning and execution processes across virtual and global supply chain networks is a critical success factor for today’s businesses. This necessitates tight information integration across business functions and a strong alignment between the business and information technology functions. In the first half of the course we will study supply chain operations of a global manufacturing and distribution company, the NOVA Corporation. Using an experiential simulation of the company’s supply chain, we will identify common errors in the design of such systems. We will see in greater detail how logistics policies, organizational design, performance measurement systems, information flows, and even currency fluctuations can impact a company’s performance. Customer requirements ultimately determine a company’s manufacturing and distribution system requirements. The course material is unified around the theme of applying five basic principles of supply chain management to global manufacturing and logistics. The second half of the course develops a framework and process for discovering the value potential of digitalisation and ensuring value realization from investments in digital technologies.

Automatic methods of Information Retrieval (IR) have gained greater significance in recent years due to the dramatic increase in the amount of data available on the Web. The data is often present in multiple forms (such as text, image, video) and hence it is necessary that the IR techniques being deployed on the web are able to perform various operations such as search and retrieval across all these different data formats. In this course, the study of IR will be focused on the methodologies of indexing, processing, and querying of primary textual data and will be extended to video and image data in the latter part of the course.

The course will introduce the fundamental concepts behind various automated testing algorithms and introduce basic concepts behind verification (specifically, model checking). The focus of the course will be more on the design of test algorithms than the usage of testing tools. At the end of the course, students are expected to gain knowledge on how to test arbitrarily complex systems. The course will provide a brief recap on the testing introduced earlier e.g., coverage-based testing and unit testing. Subsequently, it will dive deep into the systematic test generation strategies. The concluding week of the course will involve discussion of some selected and impactful recent research on software testing and draw an unusual synergy between the model checking (verification) and testing. The course will involve the development of a medium scale software project prototype from scratch (w/o libraries, w/o plugins) and the software prototype will be tested via the systematic testing mechanisms learned in the course. The software prototypes will be exchanged among different groups to mimic the testing culture in industry.

Prof. Dawn Tan



In this course, we cover an overview of engineering management including topics such as financial principles, technology strategy, and best management practices. A key focus of the course is the development of individual skills and team work in scenarios commonly encountered in engineering decision making. Some of the case studies covered include semiconductor, technology and airline companies.

To provide exposure to key principles and practices used in engineering management, and to provide opportunities to analyze cases in the management of innovation.







Class participation will be graded based on the following:



At the start of the semester, there will be a session on group formation. Every student will need to submit an idea for a new business. Students will then have a “speed dating” session to promote their idea to other individuals, one on one. The best ideas will then work to form teams of five to six students to work on the following two projects for the rest of the semester. Groups will also have to develop a complete business plan for the selected idea as part of the second project for the course.



No prerequisites, but this course requires that you do the assigned readings and prepare for case studies before attending class. A sizeable part of your grade comes from class participation, and interactive discussions during class are expected. Analyses of case studies are usually due at the start of class on the day the case study is discussed. Doing the assigned reading is expected to facilitate meaningful discussions during class.

As in any engineering company, solving a problem often requires the input of several individuals with different skill sets. Therefore, the discussion of case studies is encouraged within the project group. Students however need to write up their answers on their own and in their own words. If you use work from other sources, these must be properly cited.


For certain case studies, individuals familiar with the case at hand will be invited as guest speakers at these sessions. Engaging the guest speakers with questions and meaningful discussions about the case studies will form an important component of your participation grade.

To discuss how learning, motivational and behavioural theories support the use of games for learning.
To explain the design and development cycle for serious games.
To review key technologies to support the development and deployment of serious games.
To design, develop, and evaluate a serious game prototype using an instructional design approach.
To critically appraise the Serious Games Design Assessment Framework (SGDA).
To discuss current serious game research, in particular for healthcare applications.
Like any other instructional solution, a game should be carefully designed, developed, and implemented to facilitate learning. The goal of a serious game is not only to create an immersive and engaging experience for learners, but to help them achieve specific learning outcomes. Game designers have a strong understanding of game goals, core dynamics, game mechanics and game elements. But this does not guarantee the success of a serious game if designers do not possess solid instructional design skills and work closely with domain experts. This course starts with an introduction of what serious games are, followed by a review of the motivational, learning and behavioural theories that support the use of games in education. Students will then learn about the design and development cycle for serious games, including game design fundamentals, with a focus on iterative design, development tools, key technologies, playtest and the need for rigorous assessment and evaluation. This course takes an evidence-based approach towards information that comprises critical thinking about, and critical reading of information to review what research says about current serious games, particularly for healthcare applications. It will provide a hands-on experience for students to gain the basic skills and know-how for serious games development, through practical workshops, and a design and development project. At the end of the course, students will be competent to execute a well-informed, evidence-based approach towards the instructional design and development of a serious game.

“Philosophy will have conscience of tomorrow, commitment to the future, knowledge of hope, or it will have no more knowledge.”
– Ernst Bloch
All of us are constantly dreaming. We dream of what we have, what we want, and what we fear. As thinking things, we dwell among potential futures and alternative pasts so that we can make sense of the present. Sometimes these dreams come alive and venture beyond ourselves to encompass friends, family, and society. As they unfold, they can crystallize into new worlds that are as vivid and refined as anything real. But at their heart, even the most elaborate of these imaginary worlds is still a dream, an internal reflection on what we have, want, and fear.

The world of literature is a gateway into the dreams of humanity. By reading great works, we can delve into some of history’s greatest minds and reinhabit and revive the forgotten worlds of their imagination. We can learn a lot about their cultures and societies by how they envisaged alternative versions of themselves, whether better, worse, or just different. But more importantly, we learn truths about ourselves and humanity by encountering profoundly different ideas of how to be a human being. Reading the writings of others directs us to rethink our immediate future in the world at hand. What do we have? What do we want? What do we fear?

In this course, we will read classic works of world literature and philosophy from the last two and a half thousand years that imagined radically new worlds and ways of living. Some of these will be utopias, better worlds, some will be dystopias, terrible worlds, and others will be something in between. But all will ask us important questions about our common humanity and the irrepressible power of our imagination to think critically about the world and society around us.

This class surveys the social, economic, and political change that societies and cultures have experienced from the year 1400 to the present. Its primary theme is exchange, or the nature of interaction between communities as barriers of distance have succumbed to curiosity and new communications technologies. Among the key issues the course covers, is the unexpected rise of Western Europe and the United States during the past 500 years, the “great divergence” in material, political, and technological development that occurred between Western Europe and Asia after 1750, and the resulting impact on the rest of the world.

The course presents history in an integrative fashion, examining processes, trends, and environmental factors at the trans-regional or global level rather than presenting a series of histories of different regions in sequence. It seeks to accomplish this by emphasizing the material, cultural, and intellectual exchanges that have taken place between different regions, societies, and civilizations. In the process, the class will examine a series of ever-shifting relationships, those between human beings and their physical environment, between different religious and political systems, between ethnic groups, and between men and women. The comparative study of these relationships will play a crucial role in illustrating major patterns in history. This course will also serve as an introduction to historical and other interpretive methodologies, as students will be expected to analyze and interpret both primary and secondary source materials.
At the end of the term, students will have the:

Instructor</p><h2>02.104TS The History of International Development in Asia: The Role of Engineers and Designers</h2><p>This course is an introduction to the history of international development in Asia that focuses on the role of designers and engineers in that development. Scholars in various fields have recently begun highlighting the deep social and political effects of development projects initiated by foreign governments and international agencies across the globe. The idea that designers and engineers are simply neutral actors delivering technical solutions to practical problems is thus no longer tenable. As such, this course asks, “What part have designers and engineers played in shaping the social, political, and economic transformations that have taken place in Asia during the past 100 years?”

Though mainly historical, the course draws on research from the fields of science and technology studies, anthropology, and development studies to introduce key concepts in the theory and practice of international development. The course also encourages practical exercises and cases studies in order to help students synthesize historical knowledge and contemporary design and development concerns.

Instructor</p><h2>02.121DH The Question of Being</h2><p>Acquire knowledge of some central, abiding philosophical problems.
Cultivate skills in reading/writing and speaking on the one hand, reasoning/evaluating and reconstructing on the other.
Learn to reconstruct and evaluate philosophical arguments.
Deliver clear, effective oral arguments.
Students will undergo one oral examination to be conducted by the instructor. The aim of the oral examination is to prompt in students the development of communication skills through the mastery of a complex vocabulary. They will have to demonstrate to be able to use in a conversation sophisticated concepts, while at the same time to demonstrate knowledge of the subject at hand.
In addition to occasional quizzes, students will take one final written examination to assess their assimilation of the texts studied and the material delivered in lecture.
This course is centered on the question of being. What do we mean when we say that something “is”? Or more abstractly, what is being? This question has been at the center of philosophical enquiry since the inception of Greek thought, and is the basis upon which Plato’s and later Aristotle’s speculations developed, which then served as an unavoidable point of reference and confrontation for any subsequent thinker. The question regarding being and the possibility of knowing it through our mental categories is the backbone of Western philosophy. For, it is on the basis of this question that the concept of truth as “adequation of thing and intellect” has been shaped in Western philosophical tradition. This particular understanding of what truth is finds its inceptions in Aristotle’s investigation of being to then reach its most mature formulation at the dawn of modern philosophy: it is then that the reciprocal relation of man to being as one of subject to objects comes to the fore. This concept of truth has since Descartes served and still serves as the ground for the sciences and their approach to reality. The 20th century, however, has seen a challenging questioning of the subject-objects relation of man to being as handed down by tradition: the works of Martin Heidegger represent a provoking re-proposition of the question of being and hence of the question of the essence of truth. Is the relation between man and being reducible to the scheme of subject-objects? What does it mean to truly know what being is? This course aims at guiding the students through the history of this central question – “what is being?” – which, given its pivotal role in the subsequent development of Western thought, can serve as an introduction to the history of philosophy specifically, while more generally at the same time as an opportunity to pose some questions regarding the understanding of reality that guides our techno-scientifically minded world.

Instructor</p><h2>02.124DH The Modern East Asian Nexus – A History</h2><p><p>In 2012, President Obama called for a “pivot to East Asia” to much fanfare. Chairman Xi Jinping revealed a “One Belt, one Road” a year later.  While students are familiar with such buzzwords, our airwaves are being saturated by numerous talking heads expounding on such issues, what do they really mean? How has this come about? What is the historical back ground for such broad policy doctrines? Indeed, what shapes the Asia Pacific historically is not well understood. It stands to reason that an elective on the history of International relations in the Asia Pacific- East Asia should be taught in SUTD.</p></p><h2>02.128DH Classical South and Southeast Asian Literature and Art</h2><p><p>This course is an introduction to the artistic traditions of South Asia, focusing on literature, sculpture and painting. While the course will introduce students to classical Indian theories of aesthetics, that is, ideas about beauty, it will focus more broadly on answering universal questions about how and why we find art beautiful. You will be introduced to some of the canonical works and genres of South Asian literature, alongside the art and architecture of the period and/or region in which the various pieces of literature were composed. Though we will be looking at art in the distant past, the assignments are not historically based. Rather, you will be encouraged to explore South Asian literature and art as independent, aesthetic objects and, if you wish, as part of your assessment, you can choose to compose your own contemporary works of art using traditional South Asian ideas of beauty. In order to find further inspiration for our artistic explorations, during the course we will make a number of field trips to a temple, a museum and, hopefully, an artistic performance.</p></p><h2>02.132DH Being and Time</h2><p><p>This course aims to introduce students to Martin Heidegger’s Being and Time and why it is arguably the most important philosophical book of the 20th century, which has influenced and informed subsequent philosophical reflections. The course will teach students analytical skills of a philosophical text through close reading of the titular text, with the aid of H. Dreyfus’s commentary on it, Being‐in‐the–World. A Commentary on Heidegger’s Being and Time and a few other supplementary texts.</p></p><h2>02.135HT The Question of Technology</h2><p><p>The era of technology in which we live has widened the gap between Man and Nature. This divergence is particularly evident in the dichotomy man-made vs. nature-made. At the core of this dichotomy we find “making”, something whose meaning we take for granted, but which in truth remains enigmatic. What is making? What happens when the human being does something? How is the human being able to make anything? What is the relation between making, the human being and the world? These questions have occupied the entirety of the Western philosophical tradition since its inception until today. They are particularly relevant today, when the development of ever more sophisticated and complex machines is making so that human activity be unneeded or irrelevant in many domains.</p></p><h2>02.137DH Introduction to Digital Humanities</h2><p><p>This course is an introduction to the principles and methods of digital humanities, an emerging interdisciplinary field that seeks to apply digital and computational methods to investigations in the humanities. The course will focus on how computational methods and tools can contribute to the interpretive activities that typically constitute humanistic inquiry, especially to the reading of textual matter as literature. Students will be acquainted with the history of the emergence of the digital humanities and will learn about the leading methodological and epistemological issues in this emerging field. They will also learn about a few classic case studies in the field. They will also learn about the capabilities as well as limitations of computational tools for interpretation, and carry out a hands-on collaborative project as part of coursework using some of the methods that they will learn about.</p></p><h2>02.140TS Shaping Futures: Innovation, Work and Society</h2><p>Identify and describe processes of innovation from relevant sociological and organisational/STS perspectives.
Apply principles from social, cultural, and economic factors of work and innovation in the micro and macro real‐life context.
Gain insights into the role of individual agency in the areas of work and innovation.
Connect sociological and organisational/STS theories to real life and evolving examples of work and innovation.
Present a deeper understanding of how technologies develop, evolve and disrupt social and business processes.
Use major theoretical insights in organisational sociology and STS to study innovation.
Gain insights into the roles played by individuals and organisations in innovation, new work cultures and entrepreneurship
Be an engaged participant in discussions by analysing and synthesising information presented in the lectures and readings
Exhibit the ability to critique and apply relevant concepts and theories in written assignments and presentations.
This course examines the social, economic, and cultural contexts of work and innovation. It looks at the relationships and connections that inspire technological change within social groups such as teams, workplaces, maker spaces, and entrepreneurial ventures. The course is intended to cut across disciplines and appeal to students who have a broad interest in learning about corporate cultures and innovation processes of the 21st century. The course will emphasize social relationships surrounding innovation, the diffusion of new ideas and technologies, and relevant global challenges such as talent migration and outsourcing. Also, particular emphasis will be placed on the millennial and post-gen Z social actors as an agent of technological change, and how their engagement impacts the way work is conceptualized in the 4th Industrial Revolution and beyond. In addition to lectures and discussions by the course lead, the course may also involve guest lectures when possible.

Instructor</p><h2>02.143DH Artificial Intelligence and Ethics</h2><p><p>The advances in the development of the so-called Artificial Intelligence (AI) have started to raise ethical problems. These problems are of different kinds: on the one hand philosophers and scientists have started asking whether computers, once they reach a certain level of intelligence comparable with human beings, should be granted certain rights. On the other hand, there is the question of how to regulate AI in such a way that, in the pursuits of its goals, it be harmful to human beings.</p></p><h2>02.144DH Being in the World: from Homer and Heidegger to A.I.</h2><p><p>A.I. is the new frontier of technological progress. But far from being just another tool, A.I. has the potential to change the way in which we relate to the world and in which we understand ourselves. Yet, A.I. remains a human product and as such it is the result of a certain way in which human beings have interpreted themselves and the world through the course of history. In relation to this long cultural path, A.I. represents one of the possibilities through which the human being can relate to things and to itself.</p></p><h2>02.146 Financing Cities of the Future: Theory and Practice</h2><p><p>This course provides students in technology and design with comprehensive knowledge on finance for urban development and management by introducing a range of terms, vehicles, instruments, schemes, and implementations along theoretical frameworks and real-world scenarios. The entire course work consists of three large sections: (I) public challenges; (II) private initiatives; and (III) social technologies. This means that the topics of urban finance covered by this course are not only the fundamentals of conventional government finance for public resource allocation, social wealth distribution, and market stabilization (e.g., market failures, public goods, tax policy, intergovernmental transfers, fiscal decentralization, and interjurisdictional coordination) but also the advancements of unconventional corporate, entrepreneurial, and social finance for competitive and sustainable urbanization (e.g., project finance and public-private procurement strategy, international financial markets and institutions, urban climate and green finance, land marketization and land value capture, real estate investment and asset securitization, and financial technology).  The course takers are expected to acquire both hard and soft knowledge on urban finance through a few basic analytical exercises and international case studies for broader social applications and cooperative actions across sectors.</p></p><h2>02.147TS Interventions in Design, Technology, and Society</h2><p><p>In recent years, growing attention has been given to the social, cultural, political and economic consequences of design by both practitioners and social scientists who study technology. However, concern about social impacts usually appear very late in the design process, or only after unexpected consequences occur. “Interventions in Design, Technology, and Society” hopes to change this by introducing students to important theoretical tools and conceptual frameworks developed in the social sciences. Students will use these tools to uncover the economic, political, and other forces that shape the design process, explore how values and norms are built into technologies, track the effects of technologies on society, and use these insights to experiment with, and hopefully improve, design practices and outcomes. The goal is to enable social scientific reflection on and redirection of design practices at an early stage of technological production. Accordingly, the course is organised along important social scientific concepts, for example ‘network’ and ‘audience,’ each of which will be covered in two phases. First, students will study and evaluate key social scientific ideas that explain the social dimensions of technological design through readings, class discussions, and written assignments. Second, they will use those concepts to make experimental interventions, for example through archival research or fieldwork, video and image-based documentation, and creative experiments with design, in an effort to “design for a better world.”</p></p><h2>02.148HT Geographies of Money and Finance</h2><p><p>Money flows like mercury. It has entered every sphere of the world economy, transforming human relations over time and space. From pension funds to cryptocurrencies, societies revolve around finance. This course is open to students who are interested in learning about financial topics from a social scientific perspective, and will be helpful for those keen in careers in finance. Understanding the multi-scalar manifestations of the geographies of money and finance, and their influence in shaping relations (political, economic and social) are essential to designing better financial systems and applications.</p></p><h2>02.151HT Digital Worlds, Space and Spatialities: Geographical Perspectives on Digitalisation</h2><p><p>Contemporary life is increasingly being digitalized. The global information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure forms the network of Information flows that underpin the knowledge economy. Our experiences in the real world are complemented (or even replaced) by those in the virtual world. The explosion of informational and social media tools has shaped relational geography by changing how trust and authority are constructed in online spaces. Big Data analytics often include locational data that are used by both companies and governments, raising issues of surveillance, privacy and data monetization.</p></p><h2>02.152TS Urban Theory</h2><p><p>What is <em>the</em> city? This course aims to introduce and examine different theories of contemporary urbanization. Using a tripartite framework, this course engages the theoretical <em>groundings, perspectives</em>, and <em>visions of the city</em>. And according to Robert Beauregard, the city is characterized by the following four contradictions, namely, (i) a place of simultaneous wealth and poverty; (ii) a habitat that presumed environmental destructiveness yet saddled with the promise of sustainability; (iii) a polis of democracy but laced with the potential for oppressive surveillance; (iv) a public sphere where tolerance is encourage amid the marginalization of various groups. These central contradictions suggest that the city is an unfinished design project—replete with new opportunities and potentials awaiting rectifications and improvements by designers: architects, engineers, planners and policy-makers.</p></p><h2>02.153TS A History of Nuclear Strategy, Design, Technology and Society</h2><p><p>Since 1945, the world has been living under the shadow of the atomic bomb. Although atomic fission was discovered in 1938, and several nations had undertaken efforts to produce an atomic bomb during World War II, it was only with the destruction of Hiroshima that nuclear weapons burst, fully formed, onto the world stage. Introduced in combat at a time when the world system was being reshaped, nuclear weapons and nuclear power have occupied a privileged place in modern history and culture. This elective explores episodes in nuclear world history, including the international development of nuclear weapons, the arms race, fallout, and nuclear culture.</p></p><h2>02.156DH Games of Histories</h2><p><p>History often serves as the dramatic backdrop for many popular computer games we play today. Yet such historical representations are often riddled with misrepresentations and inaccuracies. This course aims at enabling students to acquire the historical knowledge necessary to build a credible and coherent history based story for video‐games through the lenses of some significant periods in European history such as the history of the rise and fall of the Roman Empire until Charlemagne and notable historical figures including Julius Caesar, Constantine the Great, Attila and Theoderic. To do so, the course will focus on some already existing and very successful video‐games, namely the three versions of the Total War video‐game: “Rome: Total War” (2004), “Rome: Total War” (2005), “Attila: Total War” (2015). Through a better understanding of history, students will acquire a firmer grasp of the value of historical knowledge and its rich potential for storytelling and the creation of compelling virtual worlds and online experiences.</p></p><h2>02.158DH Kings, monks, and merchants: A history of Asia before 1750</h2><p><p>This course is a connected and comparative history of Asia before 1750 that introduces students to the region’s major political, economic, and intellectual contours prior to British colonisation.</p></p><h2>02.159HT Equitable Tech: Reimagining Our Digital Infrastructures</h2><p><p>The course invites students to investigate how geopolitical conditions shape our differing relations to the Internet and its promises of the wireless, borderless world. Starting with the Internet scavenger hunt in their local communities, students will explore how the Internet is not an entirely virtual space floating in the ether but is where idiosyncratic technologies converge, reflecting their various material, institutional, and historical conditions.</p></p><h2>02.163 International Trade: Free Trade, Governance and Technology</h2><p><p>Trade is an essential human activity that dates back to the early days of civilization. In this globalized era, the production of goods and services has become much more internationalized, with countries specializing in the production of certain goods and services. With greater liberalization of trade, people can enjoy a greater variety of goods and services that arise from trade. As political and economic relationships are shaped by trade flows among countries, it has become ever more important to learn about trade as a highly internationalized, technologized and networked activity.</p></p><h2>02.164DH Performance: Design, Dramaturgy, and Interpretation</h2><p><p>This introductory course explores the ways we make meaning in theatre, performance and everyday life, including the domains of technology and design. We will consider closely how ‘sign-systems’ – spatial design, lighting, sound, multimedia, movement, objects and other production elements – guide the process of meaning-making and shape any performance’s dramaturgy. Importantly, this process is also embodied. This course ultimately brings semiotic methods of analysis (interpreting signs and symbols) into dialogue with phenomenological perspectives (being aware of embodied experience). These tools and skills enable one to understand how meaning is <em>created</em>, <em>communicated</em>, and <em>felt</em> in both art and life. We will explore how they can be used in myriad design and technology contexts within and outside of the theatre: engineering user interfaces, human-machine interactions, gaming dramaturgies, robotics, AR/VR experiences, and more.</p></p><h2>02.165TS Empathy: An interdisciplinary concept (Special Topics)</h2><p><p>Empathy is a valued trait in professional and social life, and is fundamental to healthy interpersonal relationships in both professional and social contexts. Learning about empathy is advantageous for students of design and engineering in promoting more effective interpersonal communication through cognitive and affective perspective taking, as well as a deeper consideration of end user needs and challenges.</p></p><h2>02.166TS Urban Southeast Asia: Diversity, Sustainability and Change</h2><p><p>Southeast Asia is a region of extraordinary natural, cultural, economic, and socio-political diversity. It is characterised by both patterns of continuity across time and space, as well as far-reaching and rapid social and physical development. These changes often centre around the region’s vibrant urban areas. This course surveys a variety of contemporary trends and challenges found across Southeast Asian cities surrounding the intersecting themes of diversity, sustainability, and change. We will explore what exactly makes this region – our region – so unique: its historical context, geopolitics, cultural and technological innovations, heritage practices, and urban design. At the same time, we will investigate how these factors impact Southeast Asia’s sustainable development goals, and therefore how we might imagine the role Southeast Asia could play in the future of our world. This is a survey course, and while you will be exposed to a wide range of issues relevant to contemporary Southeast Asia, you will also be encouraged to delve deeper into one or two select topics that are of particular interest to you.</p></p><h2>02.167HT Fashion: East and West (Special Topics)</h2><p><p>This course introduces a revisionist fashion history that de-centres the West (Europe and North America) and places the East as its equal counterpart. Sartorial cultures in Asia are studied in their own right and on their own terms. Students will explore the history of global cultural exchange through the lens of fashion, understand the differences and similarities between Eastern and Western sartorial cultures, and gain critical insights into contemporary fashion consumption and industry. The course follows a chronological and thematic approach that examines fashion’s intersections with other domains of social life such as class, identity, power, and politics. In particular, students will be introduced to the most pressing issues and debates animating today’s fashion world, i.e., cultural appropriation, sustainability, and its future on Web3. The course’ emphasis on the socio-cultural aspects of fashion’s multi-faceted problems in different parts of the value chain is critical to devising creative solutions that often require cross-disciplinary collaborations.</p></p><h2>02.170HT History of Surveillance in Modern Asia</h2><p><p>Surveillance is a key component of state governance and a recurring theme in modern history of Asia. This course examines how states have attempted to apply and develop surveillance technologies with ever greater accuracy, scale, and speed (as well as when and how they did not). Geographically, this course covers from South Asia to East Asia. It focuses on how colonial, national, and postcolonial governments have tried to control their subjects and foreigners within their territory, as well as how people have responded to these state initiatives. After introducing relevant theoretical frameworks, the course will delve into specific technologies such as fingerprints, photographs, anthropometrics, and CCTV, examining their historical development and impact on individual lives in modern Asian societies.  Through this course, students will examine people’s responses to surveillance technologies in modern Asia, ranging from adherence to protest. They will be able to appraise the use of surveillance in today’s Asian societies based on its historical trajectories.</p></p><h2>02.171 Religion and Society in Southeast Asia (Special Topics)</h2><p><p>Southeast Asia is located at the historical crossroads of world religious traditions, where religions play a more prominent role in the society as compared to most other parts of the world. This introductory course exposes students to the diverse and vibrant religious traditions of Southeast Asia. It is also an avenue to explore the past and present of Southeast Asian societies. Through the lens of social science theories, students will learn about the religions of Southeast Asia through the themes of ritual, festival, material culture, gender, and networks. We will also examine how and why religious traditions influence the everyday life in the region.</p></p><h2>02.172DH Imagine Dragons: Monsters and Outcasts in Literature, from Beowulf to Murakami</h2><p><p>Why do we find “monster” characters so fascinating? How do such figures blur the boundaries between human and non-human; citizen and outcast; familiar and unfamiliar; hero and outsider? Why is difference unsettling yet alluring? How do advancements in technology––from Frankenstein’s feats of engineering, to uses of weapon technologies in <em>Beowulf</em>, to mediums of travel in Chaucer, Lovecraft, and Carroll (travelling through space, time, and dreams)––facilitate new kinds of creation, new kinds of otherness, and new kinds of community? This course examines literary entities who are at odds with community, or who reside outside of community altogether. The readings and viewing assignments cover a range of genres, contexts, and mediums; they include classic works of literature as well as more recent ones, and film, dance, and music in addition to written texts. We will explore how isolated existences can be both blessing and bane; how concepts of belonging (and not belonging) figure into societies that are structured around race, gender, sexuality, custom, ideology, and religious belief; and how anxieties about monsters often, in fact, conceal underlying anxieties about what it means to be human.</p></p><h2>02.173DH The Medium and the Message: An Introduction to Media Theory</h2><p><p>In the digital age, the term “media” has become all but synonymous with forms of mass communication like social media and the news media. But, as the field of media theory explores, media forms have always encompassed far more than these. Since the dawn of <em>homo sapiens</em>, media of all different kinds––tools, elements, inventions, bodies, voices, technologies, creations––have shaped how human beings live; understand themselves; relate to one another; interface with the world around them; and formulate identities, whether personal, racial, religious, gendered, political, or national. Throughout the epochs, media have dreamed of (and sometimes succeeded in) conquering the bounds of space and time. In this course, we will traverse diverse landscapes of media objects, technologies, and infrastructures to consider fundamental questions about the human condition. How do the things we use to preserve, express, enhance, and define ourselves end up influencing the ways we think and behave, at both personal and societal levels? How do the designs of media objects and technologies actively shape their functions? The readings for each week comprise short literary texts, mostly stories or poems, that develop insight into the week’s intellectual concepts. These will be paired with excerpts from media theorists exploring key conceptual ideas and/or media models. </p></p><h2>02.174TS The Design of Digital Platforms</h2><p>Grasp the distinctive features that differentiate digital multi-sided platforms from conventional businesses.
Understand the operational mechanisms underpinning these platforms.
Develop the ability to conduct basic data analysis based on theoretical models.
Analyse and formulate strategies essential for effective platform design.

Students will acquire a critical vocabulary and set of technical terms (e.g. narrative form, mise-en-scène, cinematography, editing, sound, genre) to analyse films and learn to construct an argument about how films produce meaning. As part of developing critical media literacy, students will gain insights into the construction of narrative through audiovisual means and the application of filmic devices to the visual presentation of information more broadly conceived. The course takes a global perspective on the evolution of film form and structure, from the emergence of cinema as a new technology at the end of the nineteenth century to the impact of digital media on the production, distribution, and exhibition of film in the early twenty-first century. It presents students with a wide selection of films from diverse film cultures (e.g. Argentina, Japan, and South Korea), as well as highlight the complex interplay between technological innovation and artistic creation. The weekly screenings and analyses will be a core component of the class.

Ryutaro Uchiyama
Collective systems function as more than the sum of their parts. From the origins of multicellular life to population coding in the brain, to human institutions like stock markets and shared narratives, we see the emergence of functional synergies across multiple scales or organization. While the psychological and behavioral sciences have traditionally focused on the individual, the unique achievements of humans among the animal kingdom derive primarily from our remarkable social organization. Converging evidence suggests that human individual intelligence is a byproduct of our collective intelligence rather than vice versa, highlighting a qualitative gap between the foundations of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. In this course, we will adopt multiple analytical lenses – psychological, biological, computational, and cultural – to understand emergent collective behavior. Along the way we will traverse such topics as social networks, self-organizing systems, economic games, animal sociality, human evolution, gene-culture co-evolution, global psychological variation, linguistic communication, and computational social cognition.

Explore the fusion of ancient wisdom and modern innovation in this course that bridges Chinese metaphysics, design principles, and technology. Chinese metaphysics is a philosophical system that explores the interplay of energy (qi), natural forces, and universal laws to understand and influence the world. It offers a way to understand and design systems, spaces, and strategies that align with nature and promote harmony. Drawing from foundational philosophical concepts such as Feng Shui, yin-yang, five elements, and referring to classics such as the Tao Te Ching and I Ching, students will uncover how these timeless philosophies can inspire sustainable and human-centred designs. Through weekly recital sessions, students will discuss on how to integrate Chinese metaphysical principles into contemporary challenges in harmonizing with nature, urban planning, product design, and smart technologies. This course offers a unique lens for students passionate about merging tradition with forward-thinking design and technology, to rethink innovation and learn how ancient Chinese frameworks can enhance creativity, sustainability, and technological breakthroughs in the modern world.

Adam Groves (Adjunct)

With the rise of AI and its potential to achieve sentience, technology appears poised to define—once and for all—our value and purpose as human beings. Yet the question of existence predates even the invention of writing, a technology that irreversibly transformed the pre-ancient world and human consciousness. To engage this moment, we will explore existence as a philosophical question— globally and across cultures—from Early Antiquity to Modernity. In parallel, we will examine the technological shifts as well as particular designs that have shaped, supported, or threatened our sense of being in the world, including the contemporary rise of AI. As informed thinkers, we arrive at the fundamental question of human society to be addressed: Will we exist for technology, or will technology exist for us? Or are there entirely other ways of considering the relationship between humans and technology?

Work organizations are complex social systems that students will experience during internships and after graduation. This course is designed to build an understanding of how organizations behave and change by analyzing the workplace through different perspectives (or lenses).

The ability to act with skill and creativity in organizations begins with the development of multiple perspectives on organizations. Humans habitually settle into fixed perspectives, unchallenged mental models of how the world works, unconscious filters determining what we pay attention to and what we ignore. These habits offer powerful economies of thought: without them, the simplest task of picking a face out in a crowd or listening to the radio while driving would be impossible. But they impose ‘costs’ as well. They lock us into a single view of the world that may not be best, that is surely incomplete, resistant to change, and will become outdated. Overcoming organizational challenges requires the discipline of interpreting what we see and hear in organizations from multiple standpoints.

As a starting point, this course is organized around three different perspectives on organizations: thestrategic designperspective, theculturalperspective, and thepoliticalperspective. Each of them offers a different angle on what is an organization, and each offers different ‘tools for action’. People naturally populate these organizations. Accordingly, we will probe some of the psychological and social processes that are at work in organizations. We will then turn to a more in-depth treatment of the strategic design, political, and cultural perspectives on organization, and examine the implications of these insights for understanding the prospects and challenges of working in organizations.

We will begin the semester with discussions about psychology, bilingualism, and research, including introduction to various research methodology and technologies used in psychological and bilingualism research; we will then continue to have a more hands-on experience in designing and conducting a research project relating to topics in bilingualism. The course will culminate into an actual research project. Topics include representation and processing of languages in bilinguals, language acquisition and related cognitive development in bilingual children, bilingual brain, research designs of observational and experimental studies, statistical concepts used in research analyses, and technologies in bilingualism research. As part of the course, there will be multi-institution conference calls with MIT, Cornell University and Rutgers University, where they are running a similar course in the Spring semester, during which SUTD students will share their research ideas/projects with students from the other institutions, and vice versa, and may choose to follow up with each other after the calls. This will encourage interactions and exchanges of knowledge between students, researchers, and professors amongst the four institutions regarding bilingualism and bilingual research.

Students will be assessed through exams and homework.
Students will need to be able to answer basic questions on microeconomics.
Students will need to be able to construct basic economic models and apply them to new situations.
Students will be asked to apply consumer theory to a variety of new situations.
The strategy of microeconomics for understanding economic behaviour is to start with individual economic agents – consumers and firms – and move ‘from the bottom up’ towards understanding market demand and supply. Following this route, we will learn how to analyse the market in equilibrium, and the advantages and disadvantages of various market structures (e.g., perfect competition or monopoly). While the basic story of microeconomics is a cheerful one for the competitive market, we will also study circumstances under which the market runs into difficulties for delivering efficient outcomes.

How do we attain status and success in society? One of the important premises in studies on status attainment is as follows: “It is not what you know but who you know.” This course focuses on how individuals and institutions build their social networks (connections) and social capital (trust, social influence, status, and resources). The course offers a critical understanding of social networks and social capital as essential factors in determining success and failure of individual and institutional undertakings. The course particularly considers the effects of social networks and social capital formation on education, finding jobs, forming ties, and building teams. This course is designed to balance theories, methods, and applications, drawing from the literature on sociology of social networks and social capital suitable for undergraduates and graduates.

This course was formerly titled ‘Critical management studies’. On the one hand, the name has been changed to reflect a shift in focus lay a foundation of core skills required for your professional life. On the other hand, the course will retain its critical perspective on management theory and practice. In other words, the word ‘critical’ in the title is two-fold: critical in the sense of something important or significant and critical in the sense of having a healthy skepticism towards the messages promoted by organizations regarding workplace behavior.

In this course, students will focus on three skills: critical thinking, communication and adaptability. Topics such as job performance, workplace communication and structures will be discussed and debated, culminating in a workplace simulation where the skills learned will be put into practice.

The course will be conducted in ‘seminar style’ which means that the 3 hours in class is built around discussion (peer to peer learning) and students are expected to read and complete given assignments before class. Class participation and engagement will be high as communication is a key skill to develop. Students are also expected to have acquired basic academic skills such as referencing and essay writing before enrolling in this course.

Please note that there is one final deadline for all out-of-class assignments (e.g. case studies, online assignments). Students are expected to manage their own time and submissions (i.e. you can submit assignments early) as it is impractical to try to accommodate the multiple deadlines, tests and exams of the various pillars, with this course.

Human life and technology are intertwined. It is difficult for an average person to imagine going through one day without using any technology. However, human beings are efficient but imperfect information processors and decision makers. Because of this, human behavior and decision are often marked by systematic departure from logical, rational ‘norms’. This course examines how technology and design interacts with, and changes, human behavior, and how human behavior redefines the status quo of technology and design. For example, the influence of technology use on memory, emotion, and well-being will be examined. The influence of human cognitive capacity on technology design also will be included in the course.

A third goal is students will develop the ability to craft a persuasive argument backed by appropriate evidence, both orally and in writing.
Attendance and Oral Participation.Students must attend class and participate in discussions. Each class is keyed to a set of readings, and it is crucial that students keep up with the readings and be prepared to discuss them in class. All assignments require students to cite relevant readings.
Oral Reader Responses.These consist of a couple paragraphs describing your reaction to one or more of the readings for a given session. Do not summarize the reading, but rather give your response to the reading. Your group will present two responses over the course of the term.
Reflection Paper.Pick any one of the assigned reading and write an analysis of the reading. Provide an introduction of the topic, critique the methodology, findings and discussion and provide further research suggestions.
Group Presentation and Report.In groups, students will research any topic covered in the syllabus and present that topic to the class. This project may be completed in a variety of ways, through such means as (but not limited to) videos, panels, or talk show formats and presentations should be no more than 15 minutes long. In addition to the presentation, your group will submit a written report that outlines the following: the presentation topic, methodology, theories and concepts covered, lessons learnt (sociological takeaways from the project) and references.
Final Essay.Due in week 13, choose any one of the given topics and ensure you use at least 4 to 5 sociology sources from the syllabus and elsewhere to answer the question. You may also choose your own essay question (please seek prior approval from the instructor).
This course introduces students to the variety of ways in which people experience gender and sexuality and what it means to be a man or a woman in a range of social and cultural contexts examined through relevant concepts and theoretical constructs. We will explore how gender and sexuality are embedded in social institutions including the nation-state, identities, family, local and global work, relationships, technology, body image and consumption.

Classes will integrate lecture and discussion. Class participation — in terms of regular attendance and participation in discussion — will count strongly towards the final grade. Occasionally students will break into small groups for more concentrated discussion. Some lectures will directly engage the readings, while others will integrate background and theoretical information. The course and assignment have been designed to facilitate a bridge between theory and everyday life.

This course introduces students to the social scientific study of human-environment interactions through the history and culture of a single agricultural crop: rice. The cultivation of rice dates back almost 10,000 years in Asia, and forms the core of an independent origin of civilization, distinct from other Eurasian sites that were all based around wheat/barley and millet. Some scholars hypothesize that the cultivation of rice also supports a distinctive Asian form of society, and mode of historical or technological development, that differs from standard frameworks of ‘Western’ modernization. Today rice is one of the most intensively researched crops, as both a model organism for advanced research in genomics and an important object of genetic modification experiments. We will explore how the cultivation of rice raises exciting and provocative questions about the relationships among society, technology and environment. The course asks whether Asia’s history and culture of rice can provide an alternative figure of technological development and design, and perhaps a model for a sustainable relationship between humans and their natural environments.

Planetary threats and the Anthropocene
When tsunamis flood cities, earthquakes turn highways to rubble, and epidemics of killer disease break out, we often blame Nature for bringing disaster onto vulnerable human populations.  To prevent future catastrophe, we place our faith in science and technology, hoping to better control Nature’s forces next time.  Yet the fault lines of disaster often fall along lines laid out by human activities and plans, including earlier projects of science and engineering.  Flooding in one part of New Orleans resulted from the construction of dykes in other parts, for instance; and the 3-11 tsunami’s most terrible outcome was due to the design and location of the Fukushima nuclear plant.

In this course, we explore these human, social and cultural dimensions of natural and technological disasters.  The course begins by exploring how the idea of a ‘natural’ disaster, devoid of divine intervention or religious meaning, first emerged.  Through a series of cases from around the world, the course then explores why contemporary disasters can be considered “unnatural:” how do disasters expose and exacerbate the contours of social inequality?  How has human technological intervention increased vulnerability to disaster?  How are science, technology, economy and politics implicated in disaster response?  And how can the variations of culture, belief and cosmology be included in our understanding of disasters?

In their assignments, students will conduct ‘social autopsies’ of disasters, and will appraise how technological design and engineering can both mitigate and enhance the risk and vulnerability to disaster.

Topics Covered
Instructor</p><h2>02.226 Leaders & Followers</h2><p><p>This course is part of a suite of three electives in management studies taught by Dr Grace Dixon (the other two being <a href="https://hass.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-subjects/elective/02-202-organizational-processes"><em>Organizational Process</em></a> and <a href="https://hass.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-subjects/elective/02-211-critical-management-studies"><em>Critical Management Skills</em></a>). Students who have completed these courses recommend starting with <em>Organizational Process</em> before considering <em>Leaders and Followers</em>. It can, nevertheless, be taken as a standalone module.</p></p><h2>02.228TS Design in the Anthropocene</h2><p><p>The ‘Anthropocene’ refers to ‘(the) Age of Mankind’—the subsequent geological age after the Holocene that denotes the significant and unprecedented impacts of human actions on different global systems. The world in the Anthropocene is quintessentially, a ‘world as design’. Yet design studies have yet to be connected to, or contextualized within, the novel conditions that accompany the onset of the Anthropocene, when artificial design has unprecedentedly become the background, as well as the approach, for coordinating and supporting everyday life. What are the new categories for design in the Anthropocene? Furthermore, how do these categories and concepts modify, or even confound, what we already understand in design theory? What then are the new issues and challenges for design in the Anthropocene? In this course, existing design theory will be introduced, and explicated in relation to the Anthropocene condition through seven emerging topical issues: (i) designing with living systems 1 (human-beings); (ii) designing with living systems 2 (more-than-human agencies and other ecosystems); (iii) open systems and incomplete design; (iv) large-scale sociotechnical systems 1: Smart Cities; (v) large-scale sociotechnical systems 2: Artificial Intelligence; (vi) large-scale sociotechnical systems 3: Climate change adaptations; (vii) design ethics.</p></p><h2>02.230TS Health Communication and Behavior Change</h2><p><p>There is an increasing recognition of the role social and technological factors play in shaping the health and well-being of individuals. Communication, from the personal to mass and social media, have been demonstrated to have both beneficial and harmful effects on health and well-being. This course provides an introduction to the theory and practice of health communication and behavior change. It will cover the definition and history of health communication, the role of media and technology, social scientific theories used in health communication and behavior change, as well as how these theories can be applied to the real-world. The course will aim to bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world examples, and is suitable for students with varying interests, especially those who are interested in harnessing communication, design, and technology for better health and well-being in society.</p></p><h2>02.231TS Transportation Technology and Policy in Urban Progress</h2><p><p>This course introduces a conceptual framework for understanding real-world topics related to transportation technology and urban policy applications by examining a variety of international cases and development practices, including Singapore and other emerging economies in Asia, in a comparative manner. Particularly, the course tries to inspect and explain the dynamic and complex interplays between (i) evolving transportation technology, (ii) entrepreneurial state policy, and (iii) urban market progress/shrinkage on different network levels and/or geographic scales – macro, mezzo, and micro – in contemporary development and even prospect management contexts. Therefore, the “technologies” covered by this course are not only typical urban travel modes within cities (e.g., private automobile, public transit, and non-motorized transportation) but also extensive and unconventional interregional passenger, freight, and communication systems across cities (e.g., aviation, high-speed rail, worldwide e-commerce and e-logistics, and emerging smart applications). The urban influences of various transportation technologies in globalization as well as localization are widely reviewed from engineering, financial, economic, environmental, and social standpoints, and technological potentials and policy challenges are proactively discussed for upcoming applications in Asia’s urban development and management contexts.</p></p><h2>03.007 Design Thinking and Innovation</h2><p>Identify concepts, themes and skills related to design
Conduct a design process by applying those concepts, themes and skills
Identify and apply the basics of a design process in a variety of contexts, scales and functions
Plan and execute effective teamwork

Emphasis is placed on developing high-quality drawing skills and workflows that leverage advanced software tools. By weaving together orthographic drawings, axonometric illustrations, and emerging AI solutions, students learn to document, analyse, and transform physical spaces with precision and creativity.

Participants tackle progressively complex tasks, from conceptual planning to prototyping, while refining presentations through data-driven simulations and digital fabrication techniques such as 3D printing. They orchestrate efficient workflows that blend analog and digital methods, gaining technical fluency and a deep understanding of foundational design principles like scale, proportion, and spatial hierarchy. These experiences encourage holistic problem-solving, helping students confidently integrate state-of-the-art technologies into their spatial design processes.</p><h2>20.099 Urban Sketching</h2><p>Sketching is a way of communication and expression. Sketching architecture is a way to understand and record our spatial environment. Urban Sketching is designed to equip students with fundamental sketching skills with a focus on the urban fabrics and landscapes.</p><h2>20.101 Architecture Core Studio 1</h2><p>Carlos Bañón
The studio establishes foundations for architectural design through three projects that build in scope and complexity to have students engage issues of 3-dimensional geometry and drawing, space and component aggregation, ordering systems, structure, circulation and narrative, and tectonics. The design process is introduced as an iterative form of research, experimentation, and play, enabling students to develop conceptual ideas about architecture and translate them into a series of physical and material investigations. Each exercise is envisioned as an introduction to design thinking through an increasingly more complex set of relationships with regard to formal procedures, programs, and systems.

Students are required to work in both physical and digital models, and rehearse both analogue and digital drawing techniques for each exercise. The exercises will test both conceptual and analytical thinking as well as aid in the development of representational skills.

Daniel Joseph Whittaker
The development of a building design to its actual construction is not a predetermined process. Each architectural design is an autonomous and unique scenario demanding a high level of creative invention supported by current and responsible technological knowledge. This understanding of the technology of assemblies should be less a mere familiarity with devices and products but rather, a working understanding of the forces, both general and specific, that affect the performance of building systems and the architecture. With this understanding, architects and engineers can then design physical assemblies and systems that both respond to and collaborate with these forces. The eventual humanity and beauty of any architectural construct is an almost pure reflection of the depth of both the thought of and individual, and the highly complex interactions of a collective effort. This course intends for the full depth of design possibilities to unfold and be revealed, not constrained, as technological issues are introduced. The building technology sequence in the core curriculum terms begins with an introduction to the performance requirements, physics and physical phenomena and construction systems of contemporary buildings. The intention of this class will be to link the diversity of physical forces relevant to building performance to the materials, components, assemblies and large scale systems that control and direct these forces and guide performance. This introduction will be phased to deliver to the entering Architecture and Sustainable Design student key concepts and essential analytical skills necessary for the rigorous selection and design of structural systems, enclosure and façade systems, environmental and energy systems, and circulation and interior systems. The scope of the class includes these major systems to an intermediate level of understanding and an introductory level of analysis and system design. Subsequent classes in the building technologies will build on all four systems in both detail complexity and integrative depth.

This class is an introduction to the science and physics of building design and performance and an understanding of contemporary building construction methods, materials, and technical information necessary for a responsible making of a humane built environment. It is also intended as an introduction to the historical foundations and cultural contexts in which construction technologies have been developed over time. The focus of the class will be put on an understanding of tectonic principles: the materials and components that comprise buildings, their relationship to the manufacturing processes, and the forces and physical phenomenon of performance requirements. Beyond that there will also be a substantial discussion of the environmental consequences of the construction and operation of the built environment. While the scope of the course is broad, it is not, and could never be, a comprehensive treatment of all issues regarding the design and construction of buildings. However, the course will address all of the primary forces that determine the configuration, materials and processes of construction and the integration of building systems into the completed whole.
The learning objectives listed below constitute the essential elements of a holistic understanding of the various ways in which contemporary building systems deliver services to occupants in a reliable, safe and efficient manner. The main learning objective will be the acquisition of an analytical understanding of the performance of building systems and a qualitative appreciation of the system dynamics of these systems within the larger construction and with regard to all other building systems.

Students will be able to:

The key outcome will be for the student to be able to articulately describe the performance of a building system, its function, its intended operational goals and its essential working elements. Also, the student will be able to measure the predicted performance of a system.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides rich, machine-readable representations of proposed building designs. With BIM, it becomes practical to embed into computational tools the accumulated knowledge regarding good design and construction practices. This subject is designed to provide students with fundamental knowledge and basic practical skills of the planning and execution of Building Information Models. It is also aimed to offer opportunities for students to establish a basic understanding of those elements that impact the generation of a Building Information Model, including methods of communication, data creation, social, and economic factors between trades. Building models will be challenged with analysis software to test for various performance criteria. Learning occurs through design cases of building over 4 stories and wide span structures as a way to learn behaviours of all building systems. Students will also use visual programming skills to design parametric schematics.

Far from isolated trajectories, new ideas, scientific discoveries, technology innovation, and aesthetic avant-gardes occur in a highly interconnected manner. Complex dynamics between architectural designs and their cultural and technological contexts attest that architecture is not fully autonomous as it serves, negates, distorts, questions and produces its context. The course analyses the development of contemporary architecture through its relationships with technological and scientific advances. The course is roughly organized in a chronological format, starting with a brief overview of the industrial revolution and the early 20th century, placing emphasis on the second half of the 20th century and the development of current digital culture in architecture.

Students develop an understanding of the relationships between architectural design, technology innovation and scientific ideas that led to contemporary architectural practice and theory. In this course, architectural design is placed into a broader intellectual context, which helps students not only understand the “what and how” architects do but also build perspective and framework to reflect on the “whys”.

Today, we are all, voluntarily or involuntarily, surrounded by objects and built environments driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI). This phenomenon has not only led to the automation of designs themselves, but more fundamentally, the automation of design cognition and the optimization of aesthetic imaginations for our cultural futures. If architects and designers are to continue in playing their roles as cultural producers, social activists and technological imaginaries, a holistic understanding of today’s AI systems is essential. Such a foundational knowledge will provide the much-needed historical and theoretical bases for critically reassessing the current nature of design processes and reframing the future culture of architecture and design. The course will begin by tracing the fascinating and intertwined genealogies of artificial intelligence and architectural intelligence from the 1960s onwards. This history will be vividly brought forth to the present with complementary readings on AI aesthetics, AI artists and other emerging AI design topics, such as adversarial-based design algorithms, post-truth redesign of visual culture, unsolicited algorithmic cultivation of collective design tastes, and the territorial politics of computer vision-based surveillances. Beyond the ‘critical writing’ of AI & Design, students will also work in groups to speculate ‘critical designs’ based on their newly acquired perspectives on the culture and nature of artificial designs. The deliverables are in the forms of design mock-ups, visual diagrams and written texts.

The ‘Urban Housing Typology’ seminar will discuss the complex nature of urban contexts as places to formulate human habitation. Investigating the interdependencies evolving between a building’s entity and its urban territory students will speculate how strategies for urban building types have contributed in the past and can contribute in the future to urban development.

Participants will understand the relevance of housing typology research and the potentials of designer’s repositories of known housing precedents as design expertise. Having gained a clear understanding of concepts like ‘type’ and ‘typology’ students will analyse both contemporary and historical housing precedents of building types like Block Enclosure, Urban Infill, Solitaire, Superblock, Apartment Tower, Residential Estate and Urban Row Houses. With these building types as typically evolving within and due to specific contextual conditions the investigations will make essential connections to a building’s territory, its urban type, its historical and economical context, its density and programs.

Beyond discussing precedents as a typological knowledge on merely immutable built physical forms the course will also investigate the potential of operational building strategies like incrementalism, usage flexibility and neutrality, and user participation for sustainable urban communities. Both autochthonous building types and contemporary precedents with a particular focus on sustainable building performance will be another focus.

The course is intended to give students enrolled a working understanding of how to design, construct, and operate sustainable architecture and urban design developments and projects toward achieving carbon neutral on all aspects. Students will develop an understanding of a building’s relationship to its site’s natural systems; the building enclosure’s ability to mitigate outdoor conditions; passive systems for conditioning and lighting; mechanical heating, cooling and ventilation strategies; lighting and daylighting opportunities; site and building water cycles; and health and well-being, and advanced building and environmental system simulation through a series of lectures and workshops.

Case studies will be introduced based on the lecture themes. Topics are discussed based on the physical laws that govern the exchange of energy between building and environment and how they relate to human comfort. The ability and confidence in making both quantitative and qualitative statements about building performance will help students in integrating these considerations into their future architecture and urban design work. Ultimately students will be able to understand the impact of their design decisions on building performance in order to mitigate the carbon footprint.

Workshops throughout the semester will be a series of design exercise and environmental design studies as well as calculations, which will serve as supporting documents for the final carbon-neutral project at the end of the semester.

The course is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between Architecture and Sustainable Design and Engineering Product Development. It brings together material science and digital fabrication, fusing natural composites with industrial robotics, aiming to produce innovation in the realm of sustainable design and manufacturing. It suggests that designs inspired by biological processes found in nature, may assist in transforming society toward a more environmentally benign mode of production from the ground up. This process starts from the understanding of the principles behind structural biological systems and the development of tools embracing the paradigm imposed by nature instead of those predefined by the existing manufacturing technologies. As a research and design course, students are required to develop their own proposals, methods and artefact which may lead to publication of results in journals and conferences.

20.212 Digital Design and Fabrication
Jason Lim
Augmented Reality has crossed a significant threshold in its development with the recent introduction of hardware and programming kits such as the HoloLens and ARCore / ARKit respectively. It is now more accessible to end-users who may wish to adopt this technology for their specific domain purposes. The moment is ripe for architects, who comprise one such group of end-users, to explore the potentials of AR and critically evaluate where it can be used to enhance established workflows.

If AR does indeed have the potential to disrupt how architecture is currently conceived, represented and materialized, then it would be critical to expose students to such technology. This elective course will furnish students with conceptual and technical knowledge, enabling them to explore how AR can be utilized at various stages of the design to production process. Furthermore, it will build upon topics introduced earlier in the core syllabus relating to computation and fabrication.

The objective of this course is to ensure students become adroit users of AR, as well as to contribute and possibly shape the nascent discourse around this technology in the architectural domain.

Immanuel Koh
The course provides an overview of today’s machine learning apparatus for generative design and in turn speculates on the ways in which architectural design process itself might be altered as a result of this epistemological shift towards a ‘Software 2.0’ paradigm. By situating the discourse within an experimental prototyping context, students will not only gain the practical experience of applied machine learning workflow, but more importantly the architectural sensibility to conceptualize, articulate and implement their design applications in relation to these state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. Students are expected to work in small groups, curating and preparing the dataset; selecting and training the machine learning model; and finally generating designs from the learnt data distribution. The deliverables are in the forms of a design prototype and a written report, which could be used for future exhibition and publications.

The process upon which contemporary twentieth and twenty-first century-architects design, draw, write, and build is the focus of this course. The concomitant discourse amongst critics, the resulting scholarly critique, and the written design statement is a reflection of a complex set of values, hierarchies, and judgement criteria. This course’s goal is to deconstruct the embedded and often at times hidden sets of values that influence the creation of architecture and govern its design, construction, production, use, and occasional demise. Students will emerge from this course with a thorough understanding of modern canonical design philosophies in conjunction with a more concise understanding of what forces govern the growth and development of their nascent design ethos.

Project Management is a course set in the context of Singapore’s Building Construction industry. It covers management topics necessary to bring about the successful completion of building projects, including scheduling, resource allocation, risk assessment, budgeting, and cost planning, with emphasis on sustainable design and construction. Project management aims at understanding fundamental principles, modelling methods, and tools, as well as the best practices employed in the industry today. As a management course, students are required to work individually but also in groups to practice their management skills.

The class is conducted as a project-based module and there will be no formal exams. Lectures are conducted weekly for students to understand the key principles and how to apply them practically, looking at different case studies. Assignments entail different project management knowledge areas that are eventually compiled into a group report to demonstrate the group’s ability to manage a building project comprehensively.

Frederick Peter Ortner
The course provides a cross-disciplinary overview of methods to assess and design Net Zero buildings, products, and systems in the context of global climate change. The course is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between Architecture and Sustainable Design and Engineering Product Development. The course investigates contemporary definitions of Net Zero Carbon and argues for the necessity of Whole Life Carbon assessment and design. An understanding of contemporary assessment methods is provided through study of the GHG Protocol, explicating the three scopes of carbon emissions, in concert with critically examined case studies of Net Zero buildings, products and systems.

The course prioritizes preventing carbon emissions before they take place as part of the whole life carbon position, through lectures on impact assessment, design/process optimization. Additionally, an overview of contemporary work on carbon cycle, carbon management, carbon offsets and credits including carbon capture and sequestration provides a fuller picture to students of how Net Zero carbon may be attained.

Students apply critical thinking and their disciplinary expertise to developing case study reports on a product, building or system of their choice and how it may be converted to Net Zero whole life carbon. Additional creative activities with lifecycle assessment, systems thinking, and games provide students with understanding and tools to supplement the case study with projections or scenarios. The final written report may be used for future sharing in educational context or in the context of conferences, publications.

[Latinrepraesentare‘to make present or manifest’] 1. Depicting or ‘making present’ something which is absent (e.g. people, places, events, or abstractions) in a different form: as in paintings, photographs, films, or language, rather than as areplica.

“the making present in some sense of something which is nevertheless not present literally or in fact.”Hanna Pitkin.The Concept of Representation.(University of California Press: Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1967)

“architects don’t build buildings, they make drawings”1,Evans, R. (1996) “Translations from Drawing to Building and Other Essays”. London: Architectural Association Publications

If drawings are our language as designers, we surely must then enrich our vocabulary and foster new modes of meaningful of expression to allow for the emergence of true poetry;

« forms & types of representation »operates as a testing laboratory for exploring the processes and methods embedded within the creative act of projecting.

This course attempts to both, provide a historical/theoretical context to the importance of the act of re-presentation -external to architecture, within contemporary critical thought, and to introduce a set of techniques to reconnect to the creative act, both to exceed design and to reinvent it through the formation of new narratives.

The examination of contemporary methodologies of media research and practice will provide a context for the better understanding of the why/how/when in relationship to history, technology and the human condition.

Our objective is to generatecritical engagement with mediaby research -and application. We approach this through a two-fold strategy; on the one hand, a series of lectures and seminars, wherenewapproaches to media are presented and dissected with the students through in-class analysis and textual responses. On the other hand, during the second part of the course, the students will be introduced to a variety of representation techniques, triggering hands on, in-class work lasting one week. Such assignments aim at constructingTête-à-têtestrategies that apply theoretical and practical knowledge, weaving them and (re)conceptualising the relationship between media and design through personal projects.

The goal is to ultimately sharpen students’ intellectual agility and to foster the reinvention of methods and mechanisms through which new modes of practice -in design and architecture, could emerge.

This course uses Kolb’s experiential learning, which involves numerous active learning and 2D design activities. The 2D projects occur at two instances of the term, structured to apply concepts learnt in class to address interdisciplinary problems within the EPD Pillar specialisation tracks. This is a 12 unit subject, which means that the overall weekly time commitment is, on average, approximately 12 hours. Workload is composed of cohort based learning sessions (5.0 hr.), and individual self-study time (7 hr.) per week.  The cohort based learning will consists of mini-lectures and breakout group activities.










Projects:Grades for the projects will be assigned on a group basis, unless otherwise specified.  Peer evaluations of each project will be required.  These peer evaluations, in addition to evaluation by the instructors, are used to assess individual participation on the group projects and will influence each individual’s grade.  No late projects will be accepted.


All assignments must be turned in on time. Assignments will not be accepted/graded after the due date/time. Do not attempt to hand-in late assignments, unless you have prior approval of the faculty.  Verbatim copying of any material that you submit for credit is a serious academic offense and will result in penalties and perhaps failing the course.

Students develop a holistic view and competency in the combined interactions of engineering design and engineering project management. Working in small teams, students carry out a design project targeting practical and functional devices. Students learn design, analysis, prototyping, testing, and project management methods to eﬀectively plan, organize, and execute an engineering project. Emphasis is placed on creativity, innovation, and the use of engineering analysis to reduce errors and iterations in the design process.

This course builds on the design pedagogy of 3.007 and focuses on engineering intensive design, requiring analysis and modeling to complete the project. This course prepares for subsequent courses on technical engineering analysis subjects by providing motivational case studies and contextual examples of the engineering analysis materials. This course prepares for the capstone design course 1.401 by providing understanding of all necessary steps and project management communication documentation necessary to successfully execute the capstone design project, which will make use of additional engineering topics of the junior and senior year.

This course will provide you with the indispensable computational skills required by modern engineers. We will use statistical, numerical, and computational methods to efficiently design complex engineering systems. We will go on a journey beyond the simple “toy” models that can be handled analytically to solving systems that are similar to those seen in real-world industry.
The objective of this course is to provide students practical experience applying the major analytical techniques that are essential in modern engineering analysis. After completing the course, the students will be able to use computers to statistically design and optimise complex engineering systems and use numerical methods to model the performance of engineering and physical systems.

Besides developing fundamental modelling and statistical analysis skills, students will further develop their programming skills and working principles to a level that they can computationally design engineering systems.
Students will participate actively and will be encouraged to openly clarify problems during the class. Each topic will be delivered in a mini-lecture form with interactive quizzes incorporated into the mini lecture. Following the mini lectures, students will work on group-based case problems and individual computer programming exercises. Throughout the course students will gain hands-on experience solving engineering problems by writing programming code in Python. The final three weeks of the term will be dedicated to individual projects, which will provide each student with practical experience applying statistical and numerical modelling methods to real engineering systems.
The course will follow selected chapters from the following textbooks:

The course will include instructor lead discussions and breakout group activities in the laboratory discussions.  The reverse engineering project is structured to apply concepts learnt in class to address machine design problems within the EPD Pillar specialisation tracks. This is a 12 unit subject, which means that the overall weekly time commitment is, on average, approximately 12 hours. Workload is composed of cohort based learning sessions (5.0 hr.), and individual self-study or project time (7 hr.) per week.






AttendanceClass attendance isrequired.  Your class participation grade will be reduced for each unexcused absence after the first such absence. A roll sheet will be distributed occasionally during cohort sessions to record attendance.  If you have a legitimate excuse for missing class, please contact the course instructors before the date you intend to be absent.


ProjectsGrades for the projects will be assigned on a group basis, unless otherwise specified.  Peer evaluations of each project will be required.  These peer evaluations, in addition to evaluation by the instructors, are used to assess individual participation on the group projects and will influence each individual’s grade.  No late projects will be accepted.

All assignments must be turned in on time. Assignments will not be accepted/graded after the due date/time. Do not attempt to hand-in late assignments, unless you havepriorapproval of the faculty.  Verbatim copying of any material that you submit for credit is a serious academic offense and will result in penalties and perhaps failing the course.

This course aims to extend the fundamental concepts of thermodynamics from that covered in Engineering in The Physical World to include phase-change processes, transient systems and the concept of useful work and irreversibility. This course also focuses on fundamental heat transfer processes such as steady state and transient conduction, forced and natural convection systems. These fundamental concepts are then applied to the design of processes and equipment.




The basic objective of 30.109 Thermal Systems for Power and Environment is to give a solid understanding of the science of energy and energy conversion processes. In detail, this includes properties of pure substances and phase-change processes; ideal and real gas behaviour; energy exchange in power processes; reversible and irreversible processes; application of the first and second laws to engineering systems; rates of energy transfer and heat exchange; steady and transient systems; quantification of irreversibility and connection to lost work. In addition, there is also an emphasis in introductory heat transfer concepts which includes steady-state conduction (Fourier’s law) and transient conduction (lumped system analysis and Heisler charts); empirical correlations in forced convection for internal and external flow; natural convection; fin equations (solutions and analysis); heat exchanger types and design.


A second objective is to guide you towards an understanding of the fundamental skills, knowledge, and sensitivities that are the traits of a successful engineer. These include the skills necessary to work successfully in a group (including technical and graphical communication) and those of self-education (reading, research, and experimentation). Professional engineers have the knowledge and confidence to make estimates of poorly known parameters, create conceptual models of systems, assess applicability of various models and their resulting solutions to encountered problems, and design new solutions to meet technical challenges.






Lessons will be conducted in an open environment in which lectures, practical, labs, demonstrations and problem solving will be naturally blended together. Students will learn by doing and discussing with each other and with the instructors.

This project-based design course aims to teach the students in developing fundamentals of the design aspects of biomedical and healthcare devices and diagnostics. The course has been designed to educate students to solve real-life clinical problems using their engineering knowledge by designing and developing biomedical products that can be ranging from devices, in-vitro diagnostic kits, and instruments.

During the first week of class, students for project teams (~3-4 students per team) to carry out a design project to solve a clinical problem (identified and proposed by healthcare professionals). Case studies of biomedical device designs and hands-on prototyping sessions are used extensively throughout the course. These, as well as guest lectures (clinicians and MedTech start-up experts), discussion sections, and design reviews, are designed to encourage students to consider the broader social and clinical contexts of engineering and design. Emphasis will be on the development of creative and innovative designs that are motivated by qualitative and quantitative analytical models. There will also be lectures on specific aspects pertinent to medical devices including regulatory, safety, and testing requirements and design control guidance.

Design activities include: (i) understand and document the clinical challenge, needs, users, and environment (meet clinical mentor and observe the problem by yourself at the hospital), (ii) develop technical and functional requirements and design specifications, generate and select design concepts, and (iii) perform design calculations, optimize the design, and necessary design trade-offs, and (iv) experimental prototyping and requirements verification testing. This course will have a significant communication component as students will present ideas in class, to the medical community, and to designers and engineers at SUTD.

At the end of the course, students would have gained the knowledge needed to design and develop healthcare products, acquired an understanding of fundamental principles of design process and aspects of biomedical devices and diagnostics, and learned how to execute a successful healthcare product design and development by avoiding common quality and regulatory issues.






This project-based design course aims to teach the students in developing fundamentals of the design aspects of biomedical and healthcare devices and diagnostics. The course has been designed to educate students to solve real-life clinical problems using their engineering knowledge by designing and developing biomedical products that can be ranging from devices, in-vitro diagnostic kits, and instruments.


Students completing this course should be able to:





The course will include instructor-led lectures and discussions and in-class individual and group design-activities during a class session (1 x 2 hours/week). Cohort class sessions (1 x 3 hours/week) will be the time to review team tasks, assignments, and progress. Students complete most of their design work outside of class and cohort sessions. Each week of this course will include a variety of design activities: lectures on healthcare engineering topics, invited lectures by other professors and researchers working in the medical device field, hands-on prototyping, discussions, and presentations from your classmates. Weekly meetings for each group will be arranged with the course faculty to review the progress and brainstorm/solve project design problems as well as assist in locating appropriate resources required. Like other design courses at SUTD, starting from the first week, students are expected to maintain a lab notebook or design journal that will be updated to keep track of the design process throughout the course. Students are expected to deliver a functioning proof-of-concept prototype that solves an unmet clinical need. At the end of the term, each team will give a 30-minutes presentation and discussion to the class as well as other interested parties from Medical Community and SUTD.





Projects

1D: This is a project-based course. Please refer the grading section for assessment components.


Assignments

All individual assignments are to be performed separately. Group assignments are to be completed with input and agreement from all teammates; all members of the team will be expected to be able to explain the assumptions and reasoning behind the submitted work. Homework assignments are project tasks, completing the homework is mandatory toward completing the project. Homework assignments are also components of the design reviews (refer grading section).


Peer Evaluation

Peer evaluations of contributions to group work will be used individualize grades on the project. These points are to ensure that students take an active role in the learning process and are fully engaged in all aspects of the course. Each team member will assume a Team Leader position on a rotating basis, and will be in charge of a design review or the final presentation. The peer evaluation score will include an assessment of each member’s participation level, quality of work, and leadership skills.


Class Participation

This portion of final grades includes active participation during class discussions, in-class design activities, case-study discussions, and prototyping sessions. You are also expected to actively participate in providing feedback to other teams during their design review presentations.


Design Reviews

Two separate formal design reviews resulting in a group grade: 15-minutes presentations to the class with 15-minutes discussion for each group focusing on the assigned review criteria. Each presentation and associated report. Written reports parallel the presentations and follow the formatting as described.


Final Exam

Each group will give 20-minute presentations to CGH healthcare professionals and SUTD designers and engineers with 10 minutes Q&A. You will cover the design question, approach, and development of the Final Project. Term paper will be the final report. No separate report needed.


Technical Innovation

Final working prototypes from each group will be evaluated for innovative approach to solve the proposed problem and against the group’s updated needs statement and design requirements. Whether your final proposed solutions innovatively meet the design requirements?


To gain greater benefit from the in-class discussions and briefing, you should complete the assigned reading before coming to class. Even a superficial first reading the night before the class period will improve your comprehension and retention of the material covered and can actively participate in discussions. Your performance in this course will rely on how well you assimilate the assigned reading, apply for your team project, participate in in-class discussions, and design contributions. The project result (working proof-of-concept prototype) and all purchased materials must be turned in at the end of the course.

Students will learn to operate some common instruments in the area of micro/nano-technology (e.g. UV exposure, plasma treatment machine, upright and inverted fluorescence microscope, nanoimprinter, scanning electron microscope), make micro/nano-scale devices and structures, perform experimental observation and improve experimental set-ups. The course is highly interdisciplinary in the development of integrative thinking of fundamental science and engineering knowledge curriculum through building, observing and manipulating objects at the micro and nano-scale. Students will have a broad view on how micro/nano-technologies are being advanced, and their huge impact on biomedical and precise manufacturing applications.


This is an advanced undergraduate course that focuses on laboratory learning on the topic of micro-fabrication and nano-engineering techniques. This course provides hands-on experiences via building, observing and manipulating micro and nano-scale structures/devices.  This course also exposes students to the state-of-the-art micro/nano-technologies, and prepares them with hands-on skills to enter relevant industrial careers.


Students completing this course should be able to:





This course includes one instructor-led lecture (1.5 hr) and one laboratory session (3.5 hr) with the assistance from instructor and TA in each week. The alternating lecture and laboratory scheme allows to continually applying concepts introduced in lecture to the laboratory bench top. The lectures cover the background, fundamental principles, engineering problems and practical applications of key techniques at the micro and nano-scale. The lab modules will give students the opportunities to touch, see, design and build micro and nano-scale objects and think about their design implications and the underlying science through lab sessions. For each lab module, a comprehensive lab manual containing background material, laboratory protocols and lab write-up questions will be distributed in lecture. There are 10 lab modules organized into the following categories (subject to change):



In the laboratory, 3-4 students form a group to complete all the experiments together. The small group setting allows all the students to personally experience the technique and operate on advanced tools.  All the students are highly encouraged to maintain a separate lab notebook for recording any observations, results, or comments while performing the experiments. Students will also find it helpful to carry a USB drive to download data, or a camera to record images. To ensure that there are no injuries or accidents, lab safety training is mandatory. Lab attire includes close-toed shoes; no shorts or loose clothing/hair. Follow common sense in the lab, e.g. running and jumping around can be potentially dangerous!




Class attendance and participation in experiments are required, and will be reflected in the final grade. Communication with the instructors and staff helps us get to know you, and is a valuable skill for working through problems and maximizing your laboratory experience.

No required text. Lecture note will be posted in e-Dimension prior to the lecture. In order to gain greater benefit from the lectures, the students should go through the lecture notes prior to the class.

References and extra reading materials will be announced in class

The course is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between Architecture and Sustainable Design and Engineering Product Development. It brings together material science and digital fabrication, fusing natural composites with industrial robotics, aiming to produce innovation in the realm of sustainable design and manufacturing. It suggests that designs inspired by biological processes found in nature, may assist in transforming society toward a more environmentally benign mode of production from the ground up. This process starts from the understanding of the principles behind structural biological systems and the development of tools embracing the paradigm imposed by nature instead of those predefined by the existing manufacturing technologies. As a research and design course, students are required to develop their own proposals, methods and artifact which may lead to publication of results in journals and conferences.



After successful completion of the subject students will be able to:





The class is conducted as project based module. The assignments build towards the final project. Students are expected to produce (a) a demonstration of the proof of concept of their process and products (parametric models, computer software, end-effectors, physical artifacts, visual documentation) and (b) a research publication-ready draft paper as their final report (max 3,000 words, 10-pages document, including figures and references).

40.002 Optimisation
40.017 Probability and Statistics
Iterative methods are mathematical procedures that use an initial value to generate a sequence of improving approximate solutions for a class of problems, in which the current approximation is derived from the previous ones. This course introduces two important types of iterative methodologies often encountered in the analysis and design of engineering systems: 1) metaheuristic optimisation algorithms; and 2) model-based analysis and design tools for dynamical systems.

The first part of the course focuses on metaheuristics optimisation algorithms — artificial intelligence search methods used to find approximate solutions to complex optimisation problems (potentially) under incomplete information and/or limited computation power. The course will describe a variety of metaheuristic search methods including simulated annealing, tabu search, evolutionary algorithms, swarm optimisation, and multi-objective methods.

The second part of the course introduces basic models for dynamical systems (discrete-time state space representations), core system properties, and model-based design methods for estimation and control. State space models characterize the time evolution of dynamical systems, from particular initial conditions, in response to driving external inputs. In this part of the course, we will introduce important system-theoretic properties (equilibria, stability, observability, and controllability) that characterize the behaviour and evolution of system trajectories and enable analysis and design for estimation and control.

Xu Ying
Successful orchestration of planning and execution processes across virtual and global supply chain networks is a critical success factor for today’s businesses. This necessitates tight information integration across business functions and a strong alignment between the business and information technology functions. In the first half of the course we will study supply chain operations of a global manufacturing and distribution company, the NOVA Corporation. Using an experiential simulation of the company’s supply chain, we will identify common errors in the design of such systems. We will see in greater detail how logistics policies, organizational design, performance measurement systems, information flows, and even currency fluctuations can impact a company’s performance. Customer requirements ultimately determine a company’s manufacturing and distribution system requirements. The course material is unified around the theme of applying five basic principles of supply chain management to global manufacturing and logistics. The second half of the course develops a framework and process for discovering the value potential of digitalisation and ensuring value realization from investments in digital technologies.

Database systems manage data which is at the heart of modern computing applications. We are in the era of big data, in which data is generated from many sources, in high velocity and with great variety. This poses numerous challenges in using and improving database technologies. Big data systems designed to support analytics are maturing and are becoming increasingly important to many applications.

This course covers the fundamentals of traditional databases, such as Oracle and MySQL, and core ideas of recent big data systems. Students will learn important problems in data management that these systems are designed to solve. They will experience with building applications on top of traditional databases, namely SQLite, and state‐of‐the‐art big data platforms, namely MongoDB and Apache Spark. These systems will be running both locally and on the Amazon cloud (Amazon Web Service). The students will be able to determine for themselves the advantages and disadvantages of different systems.

Automatic methods of Information Retrieval (IR) have gained greater significance in recent years due to the dramatic increase in the amount of data available on the Web. The data is often present in multiple forms (such as text, image, video) and hence it is necessary that the IR techniques being deployed on the web are able to perform various operations such as search and retrieval across all these different data formats. In this course, the study of IR will be focused on the methodologies of indexing, processing, and querying of primary textual data and will be extended to video and image data in the latter part of the course.

The course will introduce the fundamental concepts behind various automated testing algorithms and introduce basic concepts behind verification (specifically, model checking). The focus of the course will be more on the design of test algorithms than the usage of testing tools. At the end of the course, students are expected to gain knowledge on how to test arbitrarily complex systems. The course will provide a brief recap on the testing introduced earlier e.g., coverage-based testing and unit testing. Subsequently, it will dive deep into the systematic test generation strategies. The concluding week of the course will involve discussion of some selected and impactful recent research on software testing and draw an unusual synergy between the model checking (verification) and testing. The course will involve the development of a medium scale software project prototype from scratch (w/o libraries, w/o plugins) and the software prototype will be tested via the systematic testing mechanisms learned in the course. The software prototypes will be exchanged among different groups to mimic the testing culture in industry.
